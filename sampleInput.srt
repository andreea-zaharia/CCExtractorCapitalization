22
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:44,514
WHERE IS HE? WHERE IS HE HIDING?

23
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:52,314
I DON'T KNOW. I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR HIM SINCE YESTERDAY.

24
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,484
AAH! OH.

25
00:03:57,278 --> 00:04:00,697
I'M GONNA ASK YOU FOR THE LAST TIME.
WHERE IS HE?

26
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,700
I DON'T KNOW.

27
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,622
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO TO HIM?

28
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,892
YOU STAY HERE IN CASE
THAT RAT SHOWS UP.

29
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,144
OKAY.

30
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:51,373
WHO YOU PROTECTING,
YOU DUMB ASSHOLE?

31
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:55,085
A STOOLIE WHO RATS ON HIS OWN FRIENDS?

32
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,258
THEY WERE YOUR FRIENDS TOO.

33
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:11,393
I GOT IT. YOU WANNA END UP
LIKE THAT BITCH, HUH?

34
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:29,745

00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:40,088

36
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:07,968
NOODLES. NOODLES. NOODLES.

37
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,321

00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,554
NOODLES.

43
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,684
NOODLES.

I WANT THEM TO KNOW I DID IT.

46
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:12,739
- WHERE YOU GOING?
- I'M GONNA GO GET EVE.

47
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,615
DON'T.

48
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,126
WHY?

49
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:33,301
THEY-- THEY ALREADY BEEN THERE.

50
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,496
DO YOU NEED ANYTHING?

51
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,040
MONEY?

52
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:13,257
- I GOT MORE THAN I NEED.
-YEAH, IT'S ALL YOURS NOW.

53
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,090
WHERE TO?

54
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,892
SIR, WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO?

55
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:34,482
ANYWHERE. FIRST BUS.

56
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,655
BUFFALO?

57
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,326
ONE WAY.

58
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:50,331
THAT'LL BE $1.20.

59
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:04,965
I WANNA RENT A CAR.

60
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,635
WOULD YOU FILL THIS OUT, PLEASE?

61
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:13,325
- GO, GO.
- GO AHEAD, SHOOT THE DICE, MAN.

62
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:17,037
SHOOT THE DICE. SHOOT THE DICE.
SHOOT THE DICE.

63
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:21,834
THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT, MAN.
THAT'S RIGHT.

64
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,439
NOODLES.

65
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:16,068
I BROUGHT BACK
THE KEY TO YOUR CLOCK.

66
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:27,121
LOCK THE DOOR.

67
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,095
WHEN DID YOU GET BACK?

68
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:48,142
-TODAY.
-WHY?

69
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:53,981
-THEY GOT IN TOUCH WITH ME.
-WHO?

70
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,275
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT KNOW.

71
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,026
ME?

72
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:01,780
I DON'T KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT NOBODY NO MORE.

73
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:25,971
YOU GONNA OFFER ME A DRINK?

74
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:29,475
YEAH, FORGIVE ME. SURE. OF COURSE.

75
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,685
PLEASE SIT DOWN.

76
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:00,297
WHO'S ROBERT WILLIAMS?

77
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,884
I AM.

78
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:15,395
"WE WISH TO INFORM YOU THAT FOLLOWING
THE SALE OF THE BETH ISRAEL CEMETERY...."

79
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:20,067
YEAH, THE SYNAGOGUE SENT THESE OUT
IF YOU WANTED TO RELOCATE YOUR LOVED ONES.

80
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:23,278
I GOT THE SAME LETTER
ON ACCOUNT OF MY FATHER.

81
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:28,575
ONLY THE SYNAGOGUE DIDN'T SEND THAT.
I GOT THAT LAST WEEK.

82
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:31,537
THE RABBI TOLD ME HE SENT THOSE OUT
ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS AGO.

83
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:35,082
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S JUST ABOUT WHEN I GOT MINE.

84
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,629
SO, WHAT ELSE DID HE SAY, THE RABBI?

85
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:44,424
HE SAID THAT I WAS LUCKY.
THE BODIES OF PHILIP STEIN...

86
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:49,388
...MAXIMILIAN BERCOVICZ, PATRICK
GOLDBERG WERE ALREADY SPOKEN FOR.

87
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:53,892
AND THEY WERE UP IN
A VERY FANCY CEMETERY IN RIVERDALE.

88
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:59,314
WHAT'S THIS ALL MEAN?

89
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,316
IT MEANS...

90
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:08,490
..."NOODLES, THOUGH YOU'VE BEEN HIDING
IN THE ASSHOLE OF THE WORLD, WE FOUND YOU.

91
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,576
WE KNOW WHERE YOU ARE."

92
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,161
IT MEANS...

93
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,330
..."GET READY."

94
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,251
FOR WHAT?

95
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:25,465
THAT'S THE ONE THING IT DIDN'T SAY.

96
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:56,538
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

97
00:31:56,706 --> 00:32:00,834
I THINK THE ANSWER'S HERE.
THAT'S WHY I CAME BACK.

98
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:06,173
HM.

99
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:22,814
I MOVED EVERYTHING IN HERE.

100
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:30,697
I HAD TO SELL THE HOUSE,
THE BACKROOM.

101
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:36,870
YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS THOUGHT YOU MIGHT HAVE
HELPED YOURSELF TO THAT MILLION BUCKS.

102
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,206
BUT NOW I KNOW.

103
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,125
NO.

104
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,338
YOU'RE ON YOUR ASS WORSE THAN EVER.

105
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,217
BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS YOU WHO--

106
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,761
NO, YOU THOUGHT WRONG.

107
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:57,391
THE SUITCASE WAS EMPTY.

108
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:02,145
THEN WHO TOOK IT?

109
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:10,278
THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN ASKING MYSELF
FOR 35 YEARS.

110
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:24,793
IF IT BOTHERS YOU, I CAN SLEEP HERE.

111
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:29,089
-YOU CAN HAVE MY ROOM.
-NO. IT'S OKAY.

112
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:52,612
-HOW'S YOUR SISTER?
-I AIN'T SEEN HER FOR YEARS.

113
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:55,782
SHE'S A BIG STAR NOW.

114
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:00,495
WE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN, HUH?

115
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:04,833
YOU CAN ALWAYS TELL THE WINNERS
AT THE STARTING GATE.

116
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:09,504
YOU CAN ALWAYS TELL THE WINNERS,
AND YOU CAN TELL THE LOSERS.

117
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,508
WHO WOULD'VE PUT A PENNY ON YOU?

118
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:18,430
I'D HAVE PUT EVERYTHING
I EVER HAD ON YOU.

119
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,769
YEAH, AND YOU WOULD'VE LOST.

120
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:40,118
WELL, YOU'RE BEAT. GOOD NIGHT.

121
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,996
GOOD NIGHT, MOE. THANKS.

122
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:51,379
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING
ALL THESE YEARS?

123
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,385
BEEN GOING TO BED EARLY.

124
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:49,677
DEBORAH, PAPA SAYS YOU SHOULD HELP.

125
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,471
NO.

126
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:55,016
WE'VE GOT CUSTOMERS ALL OVER.
WE CAN'T DO EVERYTHING.

127
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:58,853
TRY. I'VE GOT MY ELOCUTION LESSONS.

128
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:54,200
FAT, YOU BETTER SPRAY THE TOILET.
I SAW A COCKROACH IN THERE.

129
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:11,718
SORRY.

130
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:22,020
SORRY, I CAN'T MAKE IT TODAY.
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

131
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,189
- OKAY. BYE.
- BYE.

132
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:34,199
SORRY, FATS.

133
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,917
- NOODLES!
- BUGSY'S GOT A JOB FOR US.

134
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:46,085
HURRY UP. HE DON'T WAIT.

135
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:21,788
WHO YOU CALLING A COCKROACH?

136
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:25,124
SO, WHAT ARE YOU?
YOU'RE FILTHY, YOU MAKE ME SICK.

137
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:29,462
YOU CRAWL UP TOILET WALLS
JUST LIKE A ROACH. SO, WHAT ARE YOU?

138
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,172
LET GO!

139
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:35,301
I MAKE YOU SICK, HUH? THEN HOW
COME YOU SHOWED ME YOUR TUSH?

140
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,845
HM. TO A ROACH.

141
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:44,811
GO LOOK AT YOURSELF, DAVID AARONSON.

142
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:03,621
SHE DON'T LEAVE ME ALONE, I'M GONNA
GIVE HER WHAT SHE'S ASKING FOR.

143
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:06,332
-WHAT'S BUGSY WANT?
-WE GOTTA WAKE UP A DEADBEAT.

144
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,627
THAT SCHMUCK AT THE NEWSSTAND
DIDN'T PAY.

145
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,845
HERE'S YOUR MONEY, SIR.

146
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:23,117
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

147
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:30,458
- HA-HA-HA.
-LOOK AT IT, IT LOOKS GREAT! WOW!

148
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:40,510
COME ON, GUYS.

149
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:50,895
COME ON, COME ON.

150
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:53,856
NOW MAKE UP YOUR MIND.

151
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:57,652
-NOODLES, LET'S TAKE THE DOLLAR.
-YEAH.

152
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:00,363
SKIP, HERE YOU GO.

153
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:03,991
THAT ONE.

154
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:06,244
HIM.

155
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,996
HEY, SAM, I'LL SEE YOU NEXT THURSDAY.

156
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:13,084
- THAT ONE.
- HEY, AND BRING YOUR WIFE ALONG.

157
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,461
ARE YOU NUTS?

158
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:19,841
BUGSY SAID WE COULD TAKE THE DOLLAR
OR WE COULD ROLL THE DRUNK.

159
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:22,301
YEAH, BUT HE AIN'T EVEN DRUNK YET.

160
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:24,512
WE'LL WAIT.

161
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:32,311
-WELL, YOU ROLL THAT ONE OVER THERE.
-WHAT'S TO ROLL? HE DRUNK IT ALL.

162
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:39,277
BOUNCE THAT LITTLE SHIKKER.

163
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:29,744
JACKET.

164
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:41,964
IT'S FARTFACE.

165
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:46,886
SHIT!

166
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,681
WE SHOULD'VE TOOK THE DOLLAR.

167
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:54,727
COULD'VE HAD 10 HOT CORNED-BEEF
SANDWICHES ON POPPY-SEED ROLLS.

168
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:12,245
LOOK, THE WAGON WILL HIDE US
FROM FARTFACE. GET READY!

169
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,651
NOW! THROW YOUR JACKET OVER HIM.

170
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:50,658
HEY, MISTER, YOU SICK? AW, POOR GUY,
YOU'LL BE OKAY. COME ON, I'LL HELP YOU.

171
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:53,661
COME ON, UP YOU GO.

172
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:56,497
NOW, YOU'RE WORSE
THAN MY UNCLE NATHAN.

173
00:47:56,665 --> 00:48:00,126
WHY DO YOU WANT TO GET SOUSED?
YOU CAN'T EVEN WALK. I'LL TAKE YOU HOME.

174
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,128
GO, MAMA.

175
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:14,348
STOP RIGHT THERE. HEY, YOU!
YEAH, I'M TALKING TO YOU.

176
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:17,852
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU KIDS DOING HERE?

177
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:21,856
-WHAT ARE WE KIDS DOING HERE?
-WE'RE GETTING IT UP THE ASS.

178
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:25,651
YEAH, GETTING SCREWED.
IS THERE A LAW AGAINST IT?

179
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:29,780
CAN YOU SPARE A DIME FOR
PISHERKEHS THAT JUST GOT IT UP THE ASS?

180
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:32,700
COME ON, GET OUT OF HERE.
COME ON, GET OFF THE STREET.

181
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:35,286
GO ON, GET OUT OF HERE.
GET OFF THE STREET.

182
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:37,663
GO AHEAD. AND DON'T COME BACK.

183
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:41,667
I DON'T WANT TO EVER SEE YOU HERE AGAIN.
ALL RIGHT?

184
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:17,119
HEY, STOP BY FOR YOU LATER.

185
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:21,874
YEAH, BUT KNOCK HERE ON THE JOHN FIRST.

186
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:28,756
MY OLD MAN'S PRAYING, AND MY OLD LADY'S
CRYING. AND THE LIGHT'S TURNED OFF.

187
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:33,552
WHAT THE HELL SHOULD I GO HOME FOR?
AT LEAST IN HERE I CAN READ.

188
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:39,493
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
- MAMA, DON'T GET WORKED UP.

189
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,620
YOU GOT POTS TO CLEAN.

190
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,085
PEGGELEH?

191
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:51,255
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, MA.
I GOTTA GO TO THE CAN.

192
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,181
HI, PEGGY.

193
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:02,975
AT LEAST YOU COULD LOCK THE DOOR.

194
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:07,855
DON'T YOU LIKE IT?

195
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:16,739
I'VE SEEN BETTER.

196
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:19,825
-YOU SEEN LOTS?
-HOW MANY YOU SEEN?

197
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:23,162
I'LL TELL YOU HOW MANY. NONE.

198
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:29,502
LET ME SEE YOURS.

199
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:46,685
LOOKSIES, NO FEELSIES.

200
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:53,651
PEGGY. PEGGY, I-- I-- I--

201
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,529
I WANT--

202
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:59,865
-YOU LIKE IT, DON'T YOU?
-NOT FOR FREE, I DON'T.

203
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:04,286
YOU BRING ME A CHARLOTTE RUSSE WITH WHIPPED
CREAM, THEN YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU LIKE.

204
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:07,248
TOMORROW. I'LL BRING IT
TO YOU TOMORROW.

205
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:10,417
-I'LL BRING IT TOMORROW.
-LOOK, I DON'T GIVE CREDIT.

206
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:12,086
I PROMISE. I PROMISE.

207
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:16,423
YOU BETTER STOP SQUEEZING ME,
OR I'M GONNA POOP IN MY PANTS.

208
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:24,265
WELL, ARE YOU GETTING OUT?

209
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:15,232
COME ON, COME ON.

210
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,637
GIVE ME SIX COPIES.

211
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:49,308
DROP YOUR PANTS
AND I'LL STICK IT TO YOU AGAIN.

212
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:56,690
-WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "AGAIN"?
-THAT'S A LONG STORY.

213
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,693
AND LOOK WHAT TIME IT IS.

214
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:04,198
IT'S ALREADY 6:34. AND I GOTTA GO.

215
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,868
BOY, I GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

216
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:09,995
HOLD IT A MINUTE.

217
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:14,833
NOW IT'S 6:35.
AND I AIN'T GOT A DAMN THING TO DO.

218
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:19,046
JUST YOU WAIT, ASSHOLE.
I'LL DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR TIME.

219
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:20,547
WAIT! HEY!

220
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:23,008
SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TIME...

221
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:26,929
...IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE GONNA BREAK
THAT LAMP AT 6:36.

222
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:29,848
-WHERE'D YOU PINCH THIS?
-IT'S MINE.

223
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:32,643
-PROVE IT.
-I GAVE IT TO HIM.

224
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:35,145
OH, YEAH?

225
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,731
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

226
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:41,151
-WHERE YOU FROM?
-THE BRONX.

227
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:44,029
AND YOU GIVE AWAY WATCHES?

228
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:46,532
HE'S MY UNCLE.

229
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:49,743
-AND WHO GAVE IT TO YOU?
-MY UNCLE NATHAN.

230
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,204
MY LITTLE BROTHER.

231
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:55,833
TELL YOUR UNCLE
TO STOP BY THE PRECINCT.

232
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:57,876
- HE'S DEAD.
-ALCOHOLIC.

233
00:54:58,044 --> 00:55:00,045
IN KISHNEV, POLAND.

234
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:04,341
HM.

235
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:08,012
THEN HE DON'T NEED IT NO MORE.
IT'S BEEN REQUISITIONED.

236
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:14,059
-REQUI-- WHAT'S THAT MEAN?
-PINCHED, BY HIM. AT 6:37.

237
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:17,396
JUST REMEMBER,
I GOT MY EYE ON YOU TWO.

238
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:19,773
I GOT MY EYE ON YOU TOO.

239
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:24,611
TAKE IT! TAKE IT!
TAKE THE LAMP OFF. I CAN'T HOLD IT.

240
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:27,656
MAX.

241
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:33,245
WHO'S THIS?

242
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,041
MY UNCLE.

243
00:55:56,936 --> 00:56:00,647
-THAT ONE. WITH THE CREAM.
-THE 5-CENT ONE?

244
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,483
YEAH.

245
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:07,112
FOR THE TWOPENNY ONE SHE ONLY GIVES
YOU A HAND JOB. I CAN DO THAT MYSELF.

246
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:09,656
NOT THAT ONE!

247
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:11,825
THAT ONE.

248
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:14,286
YOU SURE?

249
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:17,331
WRAP IT UP PRETTY.

250
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:59,790
GOOD MORNING. PEGGY HOME?

251
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:01,875
SHE'S TAKING A BATH.

252
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,670
THAT'S GREAT.
WOULD YOU TELL HER I'M HERE?

253
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:08,298
HEY, MA. ANOTHER BUCKET OF WATER.

254
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:11,468
WAIT.

255
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:43,829
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?
-ME?

256
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:49,376
-MAMA SAID YOU WERE LOOKING FOR ME.
-OH, YE-- NO. THE GUYS TOLD ME THAT--

257
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:53,755
-WHAT?
-I'LL COME BACK SOME OTHER TIME.

258
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,667
NOODLES!

259
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:35,422
NOODLES! NOODLES! NOODLES!

260
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:42,137
WHAT?

261
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:43,722
DID YOU GET IT?

262
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:48,602
HIS ASSHOLE BLINKED, BUT WE GOT HIM.
NICE GOING, FARTFACE. AND ON DUTY TOO.

263
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:53,440
HEH. UH, HA, HA. YOU BOYS CAUGHT ME
WITH MY PANTS DOWN THAT TIME. HEH, HEH.

264
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:56,693
NO, WE CAUGHT YOU WITH YOUR SCHMUCK
UP THE TUCHUS OF A MINOR.

265
01:00:56,861 --> 01:01:00,739
-SCRAM. PUT THIS SOMEPLACE SAFE.
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT. HA, HA. HEY, HOLD IT!

266
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:03,200
WHERE YOU GOING?
STOP! HOLD IT! WAIT A MINUTE!

267
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:05,118
HEY, YOU, STOP! HOLD IT.

268
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:10,290
-WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH THAT PLATE?
-DEPENDS. WHAT TIME IS IT, MAX?

269
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:13,418
I THINK IT'S TIME
WE GOT OUR WATCH BACK.

270
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:17,381
-OKAY, BOYS, WE'RE EVEN.
-THE HELL WE ARE.

271
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:19,966
YOU'LL BE COLLECTING YOUR
PENSION BEFORE WE'RE EVEN.

272
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:21,760
HIYA, FELLAS.

273
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:24,429
WHAT DO YOU BOYS WANT?

274
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:26,932
FIRST OFF...

275
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:29,267
-...YOU'RE PAYING PEGGY FOR US.
- HA, HA.

276
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:31,561
OKAY. THAT'S IT?

277
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:33,397
GO AHEAD WHILE I TELL HIM.

278
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:37,609
HA-HA-HA. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
MY FIRST TIME, AND A LOUSY COP'S PAYING FOR IT.

279
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:44,282
LOOK, WHAT ELSE DO YOU KIDS
WANT FOR THAT PLATE? HUH?

280
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:47,494
NOODLES WAS TELLING ME
ABOUT A GUY CALLED BUGSY.

281
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:50,497
SEEMS HE'S BOSS OF THIS NEIGHBORHOOD,
THANKS TO YOU.

282
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:53,792
-MEANING WHAT?
-MEANING HE PAYS YOU OFF.

283
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:57,671
WILL YOU SLOW DOWN?
WHAT IS YOUR HURRY? TAKE IT EASY.

284
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,966
IF YOU KEEP THIS UP,
YOU'RE GONNA COME TOO FAST.

285
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:06,680
DO YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN?
YOU'RE SO STUPID. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

286
01:02:06,931 --> 01:02:12,185
SO WHY DOES BUGSY PAY YOU?
WHAT DO YOU DO FOR HIM?

287
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:17,649
-I CLOSE AN EYE ONCE IN A WHILE.
-WELL, NOW YOU CLOSE AN EYE FOR US.

288
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:21,027
WHY? WHAT ARE YOU KIDS UP TO?

289
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:26,366
HE'LL TELL YOU.

290
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:30,120
ME, HIM, COCKEYE AND PATSY,
WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER.

291
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:32,831
BUGSY'LL FLATTEN YOU.

292
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:36,334
BESIDES, I DON'T PUT UP WITH
NO TROUBLE ON MY BEAT.

293
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:40,630
YOU'LL PUT UP, AND YOU'LL SHUT UP.
YOU HEAR NOTHING, AND YOU SEE NOTHING.

294
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:42,674
JUST LIKE YOU DID FOR BUGSY.

295
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:44,217
SHIT!

296
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:49,514
AW, DON'T GET UPSET. THAT MAKES IT WORSE.
IT CAN HAPPEN THE FIRST TIME.

297
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:54,144
-IT'S THEM TWO TALKING OUT THERE.
-CAN'T YOU SEE YOU'RE RUINING THE MOOD?

298
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:56,646
WE MADE OUR DEAL.

299
01:02:57,231 --> 01:03:00,942
-SO TAKE A WALK.
- COME HERE, HONEY.

300
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:06,740
-FEEL GOOD, BUBELEH?
-HA! HE'LL NEVER GET IT UP.

301
01:03:08,075 --> 01:03:12,496
RELAX. OKAY. CALM DOWN, CALM DOWN.

302
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:22,714
OKAY. OKAY, COME HERE.

303
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:44,296
I'M GLAD THE BABY'S BETTER.

304
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:48,925
- HAPPY PESACH, DEBORAH.
- HAPPY PESACH, BECKY.

305
01:04:54,932 --> 01:04:57,350
HURRY. WE'RE GONNA BE LATE.

306
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,353
-OH, THERE'S DEBORAH.
-SORRY I'M LATE. MAMA NEEDED HELP.

307
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:05,442
GOOD GIRL. I JUST LOCKED UP,
AND I'M GIVING YOU THE KEYS.

308
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:22,459
I THOUGHT I'D JUST PRACTICE MY DANCE
ROUTINES. THAT'S ALL. ALL RIGHT?

309
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:25,837
DEBBELEH, MAKE SURE YOU
DON'T LET THE GOYIM IN.

310
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:30,508
-OKAY, BYE.
-SEE YOU LATER, DEBBIE. BYE.

311
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:45,458
GET DOWN OFF OF THERE, ROACH.

312
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:47,419
THAT RECORD'S JUST LIKE EX-LAX.

313
01:06:47,586 --> 01:06:51,297
EVERY TIME I PUT IT ON,
YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.

314
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:10,442
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

315
01:07:10,609 --> 01:07:13,445
-GIVE ME A DRINK.
-WE'RE CLOSED.

316
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:18,158
NICE PEOPLE DON'T DRINK ON PESACH.
THEY GO TO THE SYNAGOGUE.

317
01:07:18,325 --> 01:07:20,326
SO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

318
01:07:20,494 --> 01:07:23,288
SOMEBODY'S GOTTA KEEP AN EYE
ON THE PLACE.

319
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:27,667
THERE ARE A LOT OF LITTLE THIEVES OUT THERE.
ONE OF THEM COULD GET INTO YOUR HOUSE.

320
01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:31,004
ESPECIALLY IF YOU LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN.

321
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:06,164
YOU CAN PRAY HERE TOO.

322
01:08:07,374 --> 01:08:11,252
HERE OR IN THE SYNAGOGUE,
TO GOD IT'S THE SAME DIFFERENCE.

323
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:15,048
COME OVER HERE AND SIT DOWN.

324
01:08:48,165 --> 01:08:51,042
"MY BELOVED IS WHITE AND RUDDY.

325
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:54,838
HIS SKIN IS AS THE MOST FINE GOLD.

326
01:08:55,005 --> 01:08:59,050
HIS CHEEKS ARE AS A BED OF SPICES."

327
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:05,598
EVEN THOUGH HE HASN'T WASHED
SINCE LAST DECEMBER.

328
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:12,856
"HIS EYES ARE AS THE EYES OF DOVES.

329
01:09:13,023 --> 01:09:15,733
HIS BODY IS AS BRIGHT IVORY.

330
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:19,821
HIS LEGS ARE AS PILLARS OF MARBLE."

331
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:24,576
IN PANTS SO DIRTY
THEY STAND BY THEMSELVES.

332
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:29,581
"HE IS ALTOGETHER LOVABLE."

333
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:33,710
BUT HE'LL ALWAYS BE A TWO-BIT PUNK...

334
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:38,756
...SO HE'LL NEVER BE MY BELOVED.
WHAT A SHAME.

335
01:10:10,247 --> 01:10:11,956
SOMEBODY'S THERE.

336
01:10:24,595 --> 01:10:26,179
THERE AIN'T NOBODY.

337
01:10:32,978 --> 01:10:34,145
IT'S MAX.

338

01:42:10,791 --> 01:42:14,502
-LOOK LIKE YOU LOST AN OUNCE OR TWO.
- YOU THINK I WOULD LOSE HEMORRHOIDS.

507
01:42:16,171 --> 01:42:18,506
CAN'T RECOGNIZE HIM WITHOUT AN APRON.

508
01:42:18,674 --> 01:42:20,800
-L'CHAIM.
- L'CHAIM.

509
01:42:21,885 --> 01:42:23,678
WELCOME HOME.

510
01:42:27,057 --> 01:42:28,641
WHAT THE FUCK KIND OF MAÎTRE D' ARE YOU?

511
01:42:28,809 --> 01:42:31,227
NEW GUY ROLLS INTO THE JOINT,
YOU DON'T EVEN SHOW HIM AROUND.

512
01:42:31,395 --> 01:42:33,104
- YEAH.
- WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

513
01:42:33,272 --> 01:42:37,108
-I DIDN'T KNOW. EH, NOODLES, I'M SORRY.
- YOU'RE SOME BUNCH OF SHTUNKS.

514
01:42:37,317 --> 01:42:39,652
-YOU DON'T COME UP AND GET ME?
- HE'S THE SHTUNK.

515
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:40,903
-SHTUNK?
-YEAH, SHTUNK.

516
01:42:41,071 --> 01:42:44,407
-HE SAID YOU WEREN'T OUT TILL MONDAY.
-YOU CAN GET HIM THE NEXT TIME HE GETS OUT.

517
01:42:44,575 --> 01:42:48,619
-HA-HA-HA.
-GOD FORBID. GOD FORBID.

518
01:42:53,208 --> 01:42:57,420
WHOA! WHOA! HA-HA-HA.

519
01:43:06,597 --> 01:43:09,891
COME ON, LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN
GUESS WHO IT IS.

520
01:43:12,436 --> 01:43:14,770
MMM.

521
01:43:14,980 --> 01:43:18,399
CHARLOTTE RUSSE. WITH A LITTLE
TOO MUCH WHIPPED CREAM.

522
01:43:20,611 --> 01:43:22,111
PEGGY.

523
01:43:26,366 --> 01:43:30,620
HEY, YOU WATCH IT, NOW.
AND MY PRICES, THEY'VE GONE UP.

524
01:43:30,787 --> 01:43:35,625
I WORK IN A HIGH-CLASS JOINT NOW.
AND I GET PAID BY THE POUND.

525
01:43:35,792 --> 01:43:36,792
WHOA!

526
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:40,796
MY PEGGY, SHE'S WORTH EVERY PENNY
OF IT TOO, MY RED-HOT MAMA.

527
01:43:42,674 --> 01:43:44,634
COME ON, COME ON. EH, EH, EH.

528
01:43:45,344 --> 01:43:46,802
YOU FUCK.

529
01:43:46,970 --> 01:43:48,429
TIMBER!

530
01:43:50,307 --> 01:43:53,517
YOU'VE SEEN YOUR OLD PALS, NOW I WANT YOU
TO MEET SOME NEW ONES. COME ON.

531
01:43:53,685 --> 01:43:57,647
- PEGGELEH, I'LL SEE YOU LATER.
- YOU GONNA LAY HERE ALL NIGHT OR WHAT?

532
01:44:07,991 --> 01:44:11,953
COCKEYE WANTED TO PLAY WITH THE BAND.
I'M SERIOUS.

533
01:44:18,794 --> 01:44:20,378
COME ON.

534
01:44:47,197 --> 01:44:50,658
-AREN'T YOU GOING TO SAY HELLO?
-HELLO.

535
01:45:10,554 --> 01:45:14,515
-YOUR BROTHER'S A REAL FRIEND.
-HE'S A ROMANTIC.

536
01:45:25,902 --> 01:45:29,739
-MAX TELL YOU I WAS GETTING OUT TODAY?
-MAX? NO.

537
01:45:30,532 --> 01:45:35,077
-YOU REMEMBERED YOURSELF?
-NO, MOE. IT'S ALWAYS MOE.

538
01:45:39,916 --> 01:45:41,709
YEAH.

539
01:45:50,302 --> 01:45:52,428
YOU MEAN YOU WEREN'T
COUNTING THE DAYS?

540
01:45:52,596 --> 01:45:58,100
OF COURSE I WAS. 4344, 4343.

541
01:45:58,268 --> 01:46:00,603
I LOST TRACK AT 3000.

542
01:46:00,771 --> 01:46:03,939
-THAT WASN'T MY CHOICE.
-YES, IT WAS. IT STILL IS.

543
01:46:07,444 --> 01:46:10,571
WELL, ANYWAY, DID YOU COME HERE
TO WELCOME ME BACK AT LEAST?

544
01:46:10,739 --> 01:46:14,950
I STILL LIVE HERE. I WAS ON MY WAY OUT.
MOE SAID I SHOULD AT LEAST SAY HELLO.

545
01:46:16,453 --> 01:46:20,289
I HOPE MOE DIDN'T HAVE TO
BEND YOUR ARM OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

546
01:46:22,667 --> 01:46:23,959
NO.

547
01:46:25,629 --> 01:46:27,671
WELCOME BACK, NOODLES.

548
01:46:30,842 --> 01:46:32,176
HEY, NOODLES.

549
01:46:39,309 --> 01:46:40,851
YOU DANCING?

550
01:46:41,478 --> 01:46:44,146
EVERY NIGHT AT THE PALACE THEATRE.

551
01:46:45,065 --> 01:46:50,319
I'VE MADE SOME PROGRESS SINCE I DANCED
HERE AMONG THE BROOMS AND THE EMPTIES.

552
01:46:51,613 --> 01:46:55,825
YOU CAN COME SPY ON ME IF YOU LIKE.
IF YOU HAVE TIME.

553
01:46:57,160 --> 01:46:58,661
EVERY NIGHT.

554
01:47:15,011 --> 01:47:16,512
NOODLES.

555
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:23,686
GO ON, NOODLES,
YOUR MOTHER'S CALLING YOU.

556
01:47:32,028 --> 01:47:34,655
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN, NOODLES.

557
01:47:47,544 --> 01:47:49,545
MY PLEASURE.

558
01:47:57,929 --> 01:48:01,390
-DID YOU GET THE WINE?
-DAGO RED. THE BEST.

559
01:48:09,065 --> 01:48:10,524
HOW YOU DOING?

560
01:48:17,574 --> 01:48:21,243
THERE THEY ARE.
THE FOUR HORSEMEN OF THE APOCALYPSE.

561
01:48:23,914 --> 01:48:27,082
DID YOU SEE THAT MOVIE, JOE?
IT WAS A GOOD MOVIE.

562
01:48:27,250 --> 01:48:28,876
-HEY, MAX, HOW ARE YOU?
-GOOD TO SEE YOU.

563
01:48:29,044 --> 01:48:30,669
NICE TO SEE YOU.

564
01:48:31,463 --> 01:48:34,798
-THIS MUST BE YOUR FRIEND NOODLES.
-NOODLES, SAY HELLO TO MR. MONALDI.

565
01:48:34,966 --> 01:48:37,092
-HI, NOODLES, HOW ARE YOU?
-I'M ALL RIGHT.

566
01:48:37,260 --> 01:48:41,597
IT'S VERY NICE TO MEET YOU. BUT YOU DON'T
HAVE TO CALL ME MR. MONALDI LIKE HE SAYS.

567
01:48:41,765 --> 01:48:46,227
I LIKE MY FRIENDS AND PEOPLE I RESPECT
TO CALL ME FRANKIE.

568
01:48:47,062 --> 01:48:50,773
COME ON, SIT DOWN.
GET SOME CHAIRS AND SOME GLASSES.

569
01:48:54,611 --> 01:48:58,113
SIT DOWN, RELAX. YOU'RE HOME NOW.

570
01:49:07,999 --> 01:49:10,793
THIS IS MY VERY DEAR FRIEND JOE.

571
01:49:10,961 --> 01:49:14,255
HE CAME ALL THE WAY FROM DETROIT
TO ASK ME TO DO HIM A FAVOR.

572
01:49:14,923 --> 01:49:16,799
AND I WANNA DO IT FOR HIM.

573
01:49:18,134 --> 01:49:23,806
I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU WHO JOE IS,
HOW FAR HE GOT, OR HOW FAR HE'S GONNA GET.

574
01:49:24,349 --> 01:49:27,935
HE'S NOT ONLY MY DEAR FRIEND,
HE'S MY BROTHER.

575
01:49:28,103 --> 01:49:31,272
FRANKIE, I'LL TELL YOU THE TRUTH.
EVEN A JEW CAN'T EAT THIS SHIT.

576
01:49:32,941 --> 01:49:35,651
I MEAN, THE MUSTARD DOESN'T EVEN HELP.

577
01:49:45,620 --> 01:49:48,163
THESE GUYS WITH YOU?

578
01:49:48,748 --> 01:49:51,458
I TOLD YOU THESE FELLAS ARE WITH ME.

579
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:54,837
YOU COULD TRUST THEM.
YOU'RE IN VERY GOOD HANDS.

580
01:49:55,255 --> 01:49:58,132
JUST TELL THEM EXACTLY
WHAT YOU WANT THEM TO DO.

581
01:49:59,843 --> 01:50:03,512
MOVE SOME DIAMONDS FROM DETROIT.
KID STUFF.

582
01:50:09,519 --> 01:50:11,395
WHY US THEN?

583
01:50:12,022 --> 01:50:16,025
IF IT'S KID STUFF, WHY DON'T YOU HAVE
THE KIDS FROM DETROIT DO IT?

584
01:50:18,695 --> 01:50:24,366
EXCUSE ME, NOODLES. WHAT HE MEANS IS
THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S VERY SIMPLE...

585
01:50:24,534 --> 01:50:27,995
...BUT FOR NOW, HE NEEDS KIDS
FROM OUTSIDE TO HANDLE IT.

586
01:50:28,163 --> 01:50:32,750
HE JUST FOUND OUT THEY'RE GONNA MOVE
THESE DIAMONDS TO HOLLAND IN A FEW DAYS.

587
01:50:32,917 --> 01:50:34,877
SO IT'S SOMETHING CAME UP RIGHT AWAY.

588
01:50:36,338 --> 01:50:38,047
YOU UNDERSTAND?

589
01:50:44,721 --> 01:50:46,430
HEY, JOE.

590
01:50:47,349 --> 01:50:53,395
TELL THESE GUYS THE STORY ABOUT, UM,
THE PUSSY BEING INSURED. WHAT IS IT?

591
01:50:55,732 --> 01:50:58,942
TELL THESE GUYS HOW YOU STUMBLED
ON THIS WHOLE THING WITH THE JEWELS....

592
01:50:59,110 --> 01:51:01,403
- OH. COME ON.
- TELL THEM THE STORY.

593
01:51:01,571 --> 01:51:05,366
THE PUSSY INSURANCE. THE INSURANCE
PUSSIES. WHAT IS IT? TELL THEM THAT STORY.

594
01:51:05,533 --> 01:51:11,413
LIFE IS STRANGER THAN SHIT,
THAT'S ALL. IT'S A PISSER. NO BIG STORY.

595
01:51:11,581 --> 01:51:15,084
I GOT THIS INSURANCE AGENT,
THIS JEW KID NAMED DAVID.

596
01:51:15,251 --> 01:51:19,922
THIS KID CONNED ME INTO EVERY POLICY
IN THE WORLD. EVERY POLICY, NAME IT.

597
01:51:20,090 --> 01:51:23,884
DOGS, HOUSE, WIFE, LIFE, ANYTHING.

598
01:51:24,052 --> 01:51:27,930
I'M DRINKING WITH THE BOYS ONE NIGHT,
HE COMES IN WITH HIS WIFE...

599
01:51:28,098 --> 01:51:31,433
...A PRETTY BRUNETTE WITH A NICE ASS
WHO WORKS FOR A JEWELER.

600
01:51:31,601 --> 01:51:34,436
AND HE'S STILL ON THE HUSTLE, THIS GUY.

601
01:51:35,605 --> 01:51:38,357
SO I WINK AT THE GUYS,
I SAY, "LOOK...

602
01:51:40,068 --> 01:51:44,321
...THE MOST SERIOUS POLICY THAT SHOULD BE,
YOU DON'T HAVE ME COVERED FOR."

603
01:51:44,489 --> 01:51:47,324
HE GOES, "WHAT'S THAT, JOE?"
"COCK INSURANCE."

604
01:51:48,743 --> 01:51:53,414
"YOU MAKE ME A POLICY THAT
WHEN IT DON'T WORK, I GET A PAYMENT...

605
01:51:53,581 --> 01:51:55,749
...I'LL WRITE OUT A CHECK NOW."

606
01:51:57,836 --> 01:52:03,674
HE THINKS, HE SAYS, "OH, I DON'T KNOW
IF THE ACTUALITY GAUGES GOVERN THIS...

607
01:52:03,883 --> 01:52:06,009
...BUT WE CAN MAKE A POLICY.

608
01:52:06,177 --> 01:52:09,430
BUT YOU GOTTA GUARANTEE
YOU'RE IN GOOD HEALTH NOW."

609
01:52:09,597 --> 01:52:14,309
"OH, THAT'S SIMPLE. LOOK, LEAVE HER WITH ME.
COME BACK AND SEE IF IT STANDS UP.

610
01:52:14,477 --> 01:52:17,438
IF IT STANDS UP, THEN YOU KNOW
I'M IN GOOD HEALTH TO BEGIN WITH."

611
01:52:17,605 --> 01:52:19,857
THE JERK LEAVES HER. I SCREW HER.

612
01:52:20,024 --> 01:52:24,987
NOT ONLY THAT, SHE LIKES IT. AND SHE TELLS ME,
SHE BLABS WHEN HER BOSS, THE JEWELER...

613
01:52:25,155 --> 01:52:27,197
...IS SHIPPING STONES TO HOLLAND...

614
01:52:27,407 --> 01:52:31,660
...WHERE HE KEEPS HIS STASH IN A LITTLE DRAWER
IN THE SAFE. EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD.

615
01:52:31,828 --> 01:52:35,164
CAN'T ASK FOR MORE, RIGHT?
EXCEPT, ONE BETTER.

616
01:52:35,331 --> 01:52:39,501
I NEVER PAID THE FIRST PREMIUM
ON THE NEW COCK POLICY.

617
01:52:53,141 --> 01:52:54,641
COCK INSURANCE.

618
01:53:00,356 --> 01:53:04,651
LIFE IS FUNNIER THAN SHIT.

619
01:53:05,028 --> 01:53:06,236
BUT...

620
01:53:10,033 --> 01:53:12,701
...BE EASY WITH THE GIRL.

621
01:53:16,039 --> 01:53:18,332
I MEAN THAT. BE EASY WITH THE GIRL.

622
01:53:26,549 --> 01:53:28,050
OH, MY GOD!

623
01:53:34,557 --> 01:53:35,724
OPEN IT!

624
01:53:35,892 --> 01:53:38,185
WHO'S GOTTEN IN?

625
01:53:46,277 --> 01:53:48,237
HAD TO GO AND BE A HERO, HUH?

626
01:53:54,577 --> 01:53:56,078
- OPEN IT.
-NO.

627
01:53:56,246 --> 01:53:59,248
- OPEN IT!
- DON'T-- NO, DON'T HURT HIM!

628
01:53:59,415 --> 01:54:02,417
-DON'T HURT HIM!
- GET THIS CUNT OUT OF HERE.

629
01:54:02,585 --> 01:54:05,546
YOU ANIMAL! YOU ASSHOLE!

630
01:54:06,506 --> 01:54:08,924
-COME ON. COME ON, HIT ME.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

631
01:54:09,092 --> 01:54:10,759
-HIT ME.
- WHAT, ARE YOU CRAZY?

632
01:54:10,927 --> 01:54:14,263
-STRAIGHTEN UP AND FLY RIGHT.
-I'M ALL RIGHT.

633
01:54:14,430 --> 01:54:17,307
LET ME MAKE IT LOOK REAL.
MAKE IT LOOK REAL.

634
01:54:17,517 --> 01:54:20,102
- COME ON, KNOCK IT OFF.
-I'M ALL RIGHT. LET GO.

635
01:54:20,270 --> 01:54:22,771
- COME ON, CUT THE ACT.
-HIT ME!

636
01:54:22,939 --> 01:54:26,733
SHE SAID HIT HER.
GO AHEAD, RAP HER IN THE MOUTH.

637
01:54:26,901 --> 01:54:29,778
- HIT ME!
- I'LL HIT YOU! YOU BITCH!

638
01:54:32,615 --> 01:54:35,033
- YOU ANIMAL!
- PUT A CORK IN HER.

639
01:54:37,203 --> 01:54:39,955
NO. OH.

640
01:54:40,123 --> 01:54:41,248
NO.

641
01:54:41,416 --> 01:54:43,458
NO. DON'T.

642
01:54:43,626 --> 01:54:46,295
DON'T. NO!

643
01:54:46,462 --> 01:54:52,426
NO! YOU DIRTY BASTARDS! YOU'RE--

644
01:54:56,764 --> 01:54:58,640
BASTARDS!

645
01:55:05,315 --> 01:55:07,149
TRY THE SECRET COMPARTMENT.

646
01:55:13,656 --> 01:55:15,490
ATTABOY.

647
01:55:25,168 --> 01:55:26,501
THANKS.

648
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:51,693
- WOW. NICE MATZO BALLS.
- HUH?

649
01:55:56,532 --> 01:55:58,951
WHOA.

650
01:55:59,118 --> 01:56:01,828
THOSE ARE BEAUTIFUL. LOOK AT THAT. HM?

651
01:56:03,373 --> 01:56:05,707
OKAY, BETTER WRAP THEM UP.

652
01:56:14,842 --> 01:56:16,259
WE'RE GOING. YOU COMING?

653
01:56:20,056 --> 01:56:21,556
COMING.

654
01:57:08,938 --> 01:57:12,274
-MORNING.
-YOU GET THE STONES?

655
01:57:31,210 --> 01:57:34,838
AW.... PAY HIM.

656
01:57:59,655 --> 01:58:04,159
-ANY PROBLEM?
-NO TROUBLE. KID STUFF.

657
02:00:19,378 --> 02:00:21,004
YOU OKAY?

658
02:00:59,001 --> 02:01:02,921
-HOW COME YOU DIDN'T TELL ME?
-BEING INSIDE CAN CHANGE YOU.

659
02:01:03,089 --> 02:01:05,966
I'D ALREADY MADE THE DEAL WITH FRANKIE
TO GET RID OF JOE.

660
02:01:06,133 --> 02:01:08,677
WITH FRANKIE MONALDI, YOU DON'T
SAY "YES," THEN "NO." COULDN'T...

661
02:01:08,844 --> 02:01:12,180
-...TAKE THE CHANCE YOU'D CHANGE YOUR MIND.
-YOU'RE RIGHT. I WOULD HAVE SAID NO.

662
02:01:12,723 --> 02:01:14,724
FRANKIE MONALDI IS AS BIG AS THEY COME.

663
02:01:14,892 --> 02:01:16,935
HE'S GOT THE COMBINATION
IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND.

664
02:01:17,103 --> 02:01:19,938
IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL, HE'LL HAVE US
IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND.

665
02:01:20,106 --> 02:01:22,357
YOU DON'T GET NOWHERE ALONE.

666
02:01:22,858 --> 02:01:25,235
I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE GUY
THAT SAID YOU DIDN'T LIKE BOSSES.

667
02:01:25,403 --> 02:01:28,530
IT SOUNDED LIKE A GOOD IDEA THEN.
IT STILL IS.

668
02:01:28,698 --> 02:01:29,906
LET'S JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

669
02:01:30,074 --> 02:01:34,619
THEY'RE GONNA ASK US TO COME IN
WITH THEM. THERE'S A LOT IN IT FOR US.

670
02:01:37,039 --> 02:01:41,543
TODAY THEY ASK US TO GET RID OF JOE.
TOMORROW THEY ASK ME TO GET RID OF YOU.

671
02:01:41,711 --> 02:01:45,088
IS THAT OKAY WITH YOU?
BECAUSE IT'S NOT OKAY WITH ME.

672
02:01:48,092 --> 02:01:49,926
ALL RIGHT.

673
02:01:51,095 --> 02:01:53,179
LET'S JUST FORGET ABOUT IT.

674
02:02:06,527 --> 02:02:08,069
WANNA GO FOR A SWIM?

675
02:02:10,448 --> 02:02:12,866
YEAH, LET'S GO FOR A SWIM.

676
02:02:24,003 --> 02:02:26,004
ALL RIGHT, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

677
02:02:26,172 --> 02:02:29,591
HEY, NOODLES.
DON'T FUCK AROUND, NOODLES.

678
02:02:32,678 --> 02:02:35,096
-WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- HEY!

679
02:02:35,264 --> 02:02:37,515
ARE YOU CRAZY?

680
02:02:40,311 --> 02:02:42,228
SHIT.

681
02:02:48,819 --> 02:02:52,489
THAT ASSHOLE!
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID THIS!

682
02:03:10,007 --> 02:03:13,718
DISTRICT ATTORNEY JAMES LISTER
WAS KILLED IN AN EXPLOSION OF A CAR...

683
02:03:13,886 --> 02:03:16,554
...BELONGING TO SECRETARY OF COMMERCE
CHRISTOPHER BAILEY...

684
02:03:16,722 --> 02:03:20,016
...AS HE WAS LEAVING
THE SECRETARY'S LONG ISLAND ESTATE.

685
02:03:20,184 --> 02:03:23,603
MR. LISTER, WHO WAS KILLED INSTANTLY
IN THE BLAST, WAS SCHEDULED TO TESTIFY...

686
02:03:23,771 --> 02:03:26,940
...IN WASHINGTON ON THURSDAY
BEFORE A SENATE COMMITTEE.

687
02:03:27,108 --> 02:03:31,111
A COMMITTEE INVESTIGATING WHAT HAS
COME TO BE CALLED THE BAILEY SCANDAL.

688
02:03:31,278 --> 02:03:34,656
A SPECIAL TEAM OF DETECTIVES
HAS BEEN ASSIGNED TO THE CASE.

689
02:03:34,824 --> 02:03:39,661
AS FOR SECRETARY BAILEY, HE WAS NOT
AVAILABLE FOR ANY STATEMENT AT THIS TIME.

690
02:03:40,538 --> 02:03:41,663
DID YOU KNOW THOSE GUYS?

691
02:03:41,831 --> 02:03:45,166
--OFFICES OF HIS LONGTIME LEGAL ADVISOR,
IRVING GOLD...

692
02:03:45,334 --> 02:03:47,877
...IN HOPES OF GETTING SOME COMMENT.

693
02:03:48,045 --> 02:03:52,465
MR. GOLD, YOU'RE AWARE
THAT DISTRICT ATTORNEY LISTER...

694
02:03:52,633 --> 02:03:56,553
...IS THE SECOND WITNESS IN THE BAILEY
SCANDAL TO MEET A SUDDEN AND VIOLENT END.

695
02:03:56,720 --> 02:04:00,223
THE FIRST WAS THOMAS FINNEY,
UNDERSECRETARY OF COMMERCE...

696
02:04:00,391 --> 02:04:04,602
...WHO FELL TO HIS DEATH FROM
HIS 15TH-FLOOR OFFICE JUST A MONTH AGO.

697
02:04:04,770 --> 02:04:06,396
DO YOU THINK THERE'S A CONNECTION--?

698
02:04:06,564 --> 02:04:10,567
TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN, NOODLES.
WHAT THE HELL'S KEEPING YOU HERE?

699
02:04:11,527 --> 02:04:14,362
THE ONLY REMAINING WITNESS
IS THE MAN WHO...

700
02:04:14,530 --> 02:04:19,659
...RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY HAS GIVEN HIS NAME
TO THIS WHOLE AFFAIR, SECRETARY BAILEY.

701
02:04:19,827 --> 02:04:22,579
-I'M CURIOUS.
- WHAT DOES THE SECRETARY THINK?

702
02:04:22,746 --> 02:04:24,747
THE SECRETARY HAS NO WORRIES.

703
02:04:24,915 --> 02:04:29,752
SIR, IF HE HAS NO WORRIES, WHY THEN HAS
HE RETREATED TO HIS PLACE ON LONG ISLAND?

704
02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:33,673
FAR FROM RETREATING, HE'S BUSY PREPARING
HIS ATTACK ON THE QUESTIONS...

705
02:04:33,841 --> 02:04:35,675
...HE WILL BE ASKED BY THE COMMITTEE.

706
02:04:35,843 --> 02:04:38,386
I'D CALL THEM ACCUSATIONS
MORE THAN QUESTIONS, SIR.

707
02:04:38,554 --> 02:04:41,222
-THE SECRETARY HAS NO WORRIES.
- BUT THE PUBLIC DOES.

708
02:04:41,390 --> 02:04:45,935
PARTICULARLY IN VIEW OF THE RUMORS
ABOUT RIGGED CONTRACTS, BRIBERY...

709
02:04:46,103 --> 02:04:50,565
...THE INTERNATIONAL MAFIA. ESPECIALLY
THOSE DEALING WITH THE ILLEGAL USE...

710
02:04:50,733 --> 02:04:53,610
...OF THE TRANSPORT UNION
PENSION FUNDS.

711
02:04:53,777 --> 02:04:56,112
COULD YOU TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT THAT?

712
02:04:56,280 --> 02:05:02,118
GENTLEMEN, I DENY ALL OF THESE RUMORS
AND ALLEGATIONS AGAINST MY ORGANIZATION.

713
02:05:02,286 --> 02:05:06,748
OUR HANDS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
AND WILL CONTINUE TO REMAIN CLEAN.

714
02:05:06,916 --> 02:05:12,462
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE, I'VE FOUGHT TO KEEP
THE AMERICAN LABOR MOVEMENT CLEAR--

715
02:05:12,630 --> 02:05:13,671
HIM, I KNOW.

716
02:05:13,839 --> 02:05:16,758
--FORCED SPECULATION,
CRIMINAL ELEMENTS...

717
02:05:16,926 --> 02:05:21,638
...OR CORRUPT POLITICIANS.
IF ANY MISTAKES HAVE BEEN MADE--

718
02:05:21,805 --> 02:05:24,933
HE'S STILL GIVING OUT
THE SAME OLD BULLSHIT.

719
02:05:25,100 --> 02:05:31,439
IF ANY GUILT AT ALL EXISTS
IN THIS SITUATION, IT LIES ELSEWHERE.

720
02:06:10,604 --> 02:06:15,191
WHAT'S THIS I'VE BEEN READING
ABOUT YOU IN THE NEWSPAPERS? HM?

721
02:06:17,236 --> 02:06:21,781
INFLAMMATORY WORDS FROM A UNION BOSS?

722
02:06:26,161 --> 02:06:31,416
YOU STILL AREN'T GONNA STOP
THE WORKERS OR THE SOCIAL MOVEMENT.

723
02:06:31,959 --> 02:06:35,211
LISTEN TO ME, YOU SOCIALIST ASSHOLE!

724
02:06:35,379 --> 02:06:40,717
WE DON'T GIVE A GOOD FART ABOUT THE
SOCIALIST WORKERS AND THEIR MOVEMENTS.

725
02:06:40,884 --> 02:06:45,888
WE JUST WANT YOU OUT OF THE FACTORY SO
WE CAN GET THE FURNACES WORKING AGAIN.

726
02:06:46,056 --> 02:06:49,058
THIS IS THE LAST OFFER
YOU'RE GONNA GET.

727
02:06:49,226 --> 02:06:52,270
YOU WANT TO SIGN IT OR WHAT?

728
02:06:58,152 --> 02:07:01,446
TELL YOUR BOSSES THEY CAN
WIPE THEIR ASS WITH IT.

729
02:07:07,828 --> 02:07:09,162
FILL HER UP.

730
02:07:34,480 --> 02:07:35,563
THIS IS MY LAST--

731
02:07:43,155 --> 02:07:46,282
HOLD IT, BOYS. DON'T SHOOT.

732
02:07:47,493 --> 02:07:49,786
IT'S ME, CROWNING.

733
02:08:02,716 --> 02:08:05,468
-CROWNING.
-YEAH.

734
02:08:05,636 --> 02:08:07,303
THAT'LL DO, BOYS.

735
02:08:07,471 --> 02:08:09,305
WHAT'LL DO?

736
02:08:09,473 --> 02:08:12,767
WE ALMOST GOT THE KID
WHERE WE WANT HIM.

737
02:08:16,605 --> 02:08:19,691
AND WE GOT THE BOSS WHERE WE WANT HIM.

738
02:08:19,858 --> 02:08:21,442
EASY.

739
02:08:22,486 --> 02:08:24,487
EASY.

740
02:08:27,825 --> 02:08:30,159
PUT THEM DOWN.

741
02:08:30,911 --> 02:08:33,496
PUT YOUR GUNS AWAY, BOYS.

742
02:08:43,298 --> 02:08:45,383
JUST SWAPPING PRISONERS.

743
02:08:46,009 --> 02:08:48,636
FAIR TRADE, HUH, CHICKENHEAD?

744
02:08:56,019 --> 02:08:59,188
UNION BOY OVER HERE FOR MR. BOSS MAN.

745
02:08:59,356 --> 02:09:01,899
WELL, LOOK WHO'S HERE. HA, HA.

746
02:09:02,651 --> 02:09:05,403
FAT MOE'S BONEYARD BOYS.

747
02:09:05,571 --> 02:09:07,655
WHICH REMINDS ME.

748
02:09:08,073 --> 02:09:11,826
HOW'S THAT CANCER IN YOUR GUT
COMING ALONG, CHICKEN JOE?

749
02:09:13,996 --> 02:09:17,790
-UNTIE HIM.
-I DON'T TAKE ORDERS FROM YOU.

750
02:09:17,958 --> 02:09:21,127
WE'RE NOT ASKING YOU TO TAKE ORDERS, JOE.
WE'RE TELLING YOU.

751
02:09:21,295 --> 02:09:23,463
NOW GO AHEAD, UNTIE HIM.

752
02:09:23,630 --> 02:09:25,631
UNTIE HIM.

753
02:09:30,512 --> 02:09:31,637
UNTIE HIM.

754
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:04,921
WHO ARE YOU?

755
02:10:05,923 --> 02:10:06,964
WHO'S PAYING YOU?

756
02:10:08,300 --> 02:10:11,052
I THINK THIS IS REALLY GONNA
PISS YOU OFF THERE, MAC.

757
02:10:11,220 --> 02:10:14,764
I THINK IT'S THOSE DIRTY, DIRTY
POLITICIAN FRIENDS OF YOURS.

758
02:10:14,932 --> 02:10:19,560
YEAH? WELL, YOU CRAWL BACK AND TELL
HIM WE DON'T WANT YOU IN WITH US.

759
02:10:19,728 --> 02:10:23,481
OUR FIGHT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH
LIQUOR AND PROSTITUTION AND DOPE.

760
02:10:23,649 --> 02:10:26,526
YOU'D BETTER
GET USED TO THE IDEA, PAL.

761
02:10:27,236 --> 02:10:29,111
THIS COUNTRY IS STILL GROWING UP.

762
02:10:29,279 --> 02:10:33,199
CERTAIN DISEASES IT'S BETTER
TO HAVE WHEN YOU'RE STILL YOUNG.

763
02:10:34,993 --> 02:10:39,789
YOU BOYS AIN'T A MILD CASE
OF THE MEASLES. YOU'RE THE PLAGUE.

764
02:10:39,957 --> 02:10:41,999
AND BASTARDS LIKE HIM ARE IMMUNE.

765
02:10:42,167 --> 02:10:45,461
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN US AND THEM!

766
02:10:47,297 --> 02:10:49,131
TAKE IT EASY.

767
02:10:49,299 --> 02:10:51,300
THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT
THEY'RE ALWAYS GONNA WIN...

768
02:10:51,468 --> 02:10:54,053
...AND YOU'RE GONNA
KEEP GETTING IT UP THE ASS.

769
02:10:54,221 --> 02:10:56,180
SOONER THAN YOU THINK.

770
02:11:13,490 --> 02:11:17,702
CHIEF AIELLO, MOVING POLICEMEN INTO
THE FACTORY CAME AS A SURPRISE TO EVERYONE:

771
02:11:17,870 --> 02:11:20,580
THE PRESS, THE UNIONS,
ESPECIALLY THE STRIKERS.

772
02:11:20,747 --> 02:11:23,332
WELL, WHAT DID YOU WANT, SWEETHEART,
A DECLARATION OF WAR?

773
02:11:23,500 --> 02:11:25,251
OURS WAS A PEACEABLE OPERATION.

774
02:11:25,419 --> 02:11:27,795
WASN'T THAT CONTRARY
TO NEW UNION LAWS?

775
02:11:27,963 --> 02:11:30,172
I'M CHIEF OF POLICE,
NOT CHIEF OF THE PEOPLE.

776
02:11:30,340 --> 02:11:32,675
WAS THERE ANY VIOLENCE BY THE STRIKERS
TO JUSTIFY--?

777
02:11:32,843 --> 02:11:36,512
"PREVENTION, NOT REPRESSION."

778
02:11:36,680 --> 02:11:38,764
BUT YOU LET SCABS MOVE IN
AND START WORKING.

779
02:11:38,932 --> 02:11:42,310
YOUNG LADY, YOU WANNA TALK TO ME,
CALL THEM "UNEMPLOYED WORKERS."

780
02:11:43,645 --> 02:11:48,024
WITH YOUR PERMISSION, I'LL TAKE THESE
FLOWERS TO MY MISSIS BEFORE THEY WILT.

781
02:11:48,692 --> 02:11:52,653
OR MAYBE YOU HEARD.
I'M THE FATHER OF A BABY BOY!

782
02:11:54,865 --> 02:11:57,366
CHIEF, ONE MORE QUESTION.

783
02:11:57,534 --> 02:12:01,996
WE HEARD HE'S THE YOUNGEST STOCKHOLDER
IN THAT FACTORY YOU OCCUPIED.

784
02:12:06,710 --> 02:12:08,669
WHAT'D YOU MEAN BY THAT?

785
02:12:08,837 --> 02:12:12,006
THEY SAY MANAGEMENT EXPRESSED THEIR
THANKS WITH A BIRTHDAY PRESENT FOR THE BABY.

786
02:12:16,428 --> 02:12:19,055
YOU KNOW,
SLANDER IS A SERIOUS OFFENSE.

787
02:12:19,222 --> 02:12:21,474
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES
FROM A HACK REPORTER.

788
02:12:21,975 --> 02:12:24,727
YOU WANNA FIND OUT HOW SERIOUS?

789
02:12:26,855 --> 02:12:31,859
BUT SINCE THIS IS MY FIRST BOY
AFTER FOUR GIRLS...

790
02:12:32,027 --> 02:12:34,570
...I'LL DECLARE AMNESTY.

791
02:12:35,364 --> 02:12:38,574
HA-HA-HA. BEHAVE YOURSELF.

792
02:12:39,952 --> 02:12:41,869
GO.

793
02:14:53,085 --> 02:14:56,087
THANK YOU. OH.

794
02:14:56,254 --> 02:14:57,838
-HE'S EATING?
-MM-HM.

795
02:14:58,006 --> 02:15:01,425
-FOR FIVE.
-FOR FIVE? WELL, WHY NOT?

796
02:15:01,593 --> 02:15:04,386
YOU COULD FEED AN ARMY WITH
THESE TWO MILK PLANTS. HA-HA-HA.

797
02:15:04,554 --> 02:15:05,846
WE COULD OPEN UP A DAIRY.

798
02:15:09,267 --> 02:15:10,726
OH, HEY.

799
02:15:12,604 --> 02:15:18,400
WHO LOVES YOU? WHO LOVES YOU?
I LOVE YOU.

800
02:15:18,568 --> 02:15:22,404
AND I LOVE YOU.
AND I LOVE YOU.

801
02:15:22,572 --> 02:15:24,198
LUCY!

802
02:15:24,366 --> 02:15:26,408
-DON'T YOU HAVE TO FEED HIM AT 6:00?
- UH-HUH.

803
02:15:27,786 --> 02:15:29,203
COME IN.

804
02:15:30,914 --> 02:15:34,500
-OH, HERE HE IS NOW.
-THAT'S MY SON.

805
02:15:34,668 --> 02:15:38,629
THAT'S MY SON. OH, OH.

806
02:15:40,799 --> 02:15:46,428
THAT'S MY SON. THAT'S MY SON!
HA-HA-HA.

807
02:15:46,596 --> 02:15:48,347
JESUS CHRIST, THEY CHANGE FAST.

808
02:15:49,933 --> 02:15:52,560
YEAH, BUT HE LOOKS LIKE MY OLD MAN.

809
02:15:52,727 --> 02:15:54,603
YEAH, YEAH, LOOK, SAME EYES.

810
02:15:54,771 --> 02:15:57,148
AND LOOK AT THAT,
THE SAME DEVILISH PRIDE, HUH?

811
02:15:57,315 --> 02:16:00,192
HEY. HEY, HEY.

812
02:16:00,360 --> 02:16:01,902
DID YOU SEE HIS DICKEY?

813
02:16:02,070 --> 02:16:03,946
-VINCENT.
- WHAT?

814
02:16:04,114 --> 02:16:06,448
-THE GIRLS.
-THE GIRLS!

815
02:16:06,616 --> 02:16:12,538
SOONER OR LATER YOU HAVE TO LEARN THAT
AFTER ME, THE BOSS IN THE HOUSE IS HIM.

816
02:16:12,706 --> 02:16:14,498
HE'S GOT BALLS JUST LIKE HIS PAPA.

817
02:16:14,666 --> 02:16:15,916
-WHOA! HEY!
-LET ME HAVE HIM.

818
02:16:16,084 --> 02:16:19,712
NO, NO, NO. I'LL DO THIS.

819
02:16:19,880 --> 02:16:21,755
I'LL DO THIS, HUH? YEAH.

820
02:16:25,093 --> 02:16:27,094
LOOK. HEY, HEY.

821
02:16:28,847 --> 02:16:31,265
OOH. HA-HA-HA.

822
02:16:31,766 --> 02:16:33,100
LET PAPA CHANGE YOU, HUH?

823
02:16:33,268 --> 02:16:35,477
COME ON, LOOK.
GIVE ME YOUR LITTLE-BITTY SMILE.

824
02:16:35,645 --> 02:16:40,524
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.

825
02:16:41,902 --> 02:16:42,943
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?

826
02:16:44,279 --> 02:16:49,450
-WHAT IS THIS? HUH? WHAT'S THAT?
- NO! NO! OH, NO!

827
02:16:49,993 --> 02:16:52,244
-LOOK.
-IT'S THE RIGHT NUMBER.

828
02:16:52,412 --> 02:16:55,748
THE RIGHT NUMBER?
I'LL BREAK YOUR GODDAMN NECK!

829
02:16:55,916 --> 02:16:58,334
FIND MY SON, OR I'LL BURN DOWN
THIS GODDAMN BUILDING!

830
02:16:59,669 --> 02:17:02,254
HELLO! HELLO.

831
02:17:02,422 --> 02:17:03,672
-WOULD YOU SHUT UP?
-OH!

832
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:08,177
NO, HEY, NO. WAIT, WAIT.
I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU.

833
02:17:08,345 --> 02:17:10,554
WELL, WHO'S THIS?

834
02:17:10,722 --> 02:17:13,140
NEVER MIND--
TO WHO AM I TALKING?

835
02:17:13,308 --> 02:17:16,101
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?
MY SON, WHERE IS HE?

836
02:17:16,269 --> 02:17:20,314
WHERE THE HELL DO YOU THINK HE IS?
HE'S IN THE MATERNITY WARD. HE NEVER LEFT.

837
02:17:20,482 --> 02:17:23,817
HE JUST GOT A LITTLE RESTLESS
SO HE WANTED TO CHANGE HIS BED.

838
02:17:23,985 --> 02:17:27,696
AND THE OTHER KIDS GOT THE SAME IDEA
SO THEY ALSO WANTED TO CHANGE THEIR BEDS.

839
02:17:27,864 --> 02:17:31,659
SO THERE YOU GOT 30, 40 SCREAMING BABIES
JUMPING FROM ONE BED TO ANOTHER...

840
02:17:31,826 --> 02:17:35,246
...SWITCHING TAGS, SO NOW
WE DO HAVE A REAL PROBLEM.

841
02:17:35,413 --> 02:17:38,499
PIECE OF SHIT WHOEVER YOU ARE!
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU SAYING?

842
02:17:38,667 --> 02:17:40,000
-HUH?
-...CAN'T FIND MY SON!

843
02:17:40,168 --> 02:17:41,210
OH, NO, NO, NO.

844
02:17:41,378 --> 02:17:44,296
LUCKILY WE WERE THERE TO SEE THAT
EVERYTHING WAS UNDER CONTROL.

845
02:17:44,464 --> 02:17:46,882
IF YOU WANT, WE CAN PUT EVERYTHING
BACK WHERE IT WAS.

846
02:17:47,050 --> 02:17:48,425
EXCEPT THERE'S ONE PROBLEM.

847
02:17:48,593 --> 02:17:51,053
-YOU GOTTA MEET US HALFWAY.
-HALFWAY. TELL ME!

848
02:17:51,221 --> 02:17:53,305
WHY DO YOU CARE WHO WINS THE STRIKE?

849
02:17:53,473 --> 02:17:55,766
THAT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH ME!
WHAT DID I DO?

850
02:17:55,934 --> 02:17:58,519
WHAT DID YOU DO?
FIRST OF ALL, YOU LET THE SCABS IN.

851
02:17:58,687 --> 02:18:01,313
SECOND OF ALL, YOU GOT THE COPS IN THERE
PROTECTING THEM.

852
02:18:01,481 --> 02:18:04,858
-THAT'S MY RIGHT. I'M A COP!
-ALL RIGHT, SHUT THE FUCK UP.

853
02:18:05,026 --> 02:18:07,027
NOW, LISTEN TO ME VERY CAREFULLY.

854
02:18:07,195 --> 02:18:11,198
YOU'RE GONNA CALL OFF YOUR DOGS AND LET
THE STRIKERS WORK IT OUT WITH THE BOSSES.

855
02:18:11,366 --> 02:18:12,408
I WANT MY SON BACK NOW.

856
02:18:12,575 --> 02:18:15,119
DO THAT,
WE'LL GIVE YOU YOUR KID'S NEW NUMBER.

857
02:18:15,287 --> 02:18:18,122
YOU DON'T DO THAT, LOOK FOR YOUR KID
YOURSELF, AND GOOD LUCK.

858
02:18:19,457 --> 02:18:21,000
-SO, WHAT IS IT GONNA BE?
-OKAY.

859
02:18:21,167 --> 02:18:24,169
-I'LL CALL MY MEN OFF TODAY.
-ATTABOY.

860
02:18:24,337 --> 02:18:27,506
YOU KNOW, AIELLO, FOR A ROTTEN,
RAT-BASTARD SON OF A BITCH...

861
02:18:27,674 --> 02:18:29,466
...YOU'RE NOT AS STUPID AS I THOUGHT.

862
02:18:31,261 --> 02:18:33,429
-WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.
-WHEN WILL YOU CALL?

863
02:18:33,596 --> 02:18:36,807
DON'T WORRY, DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH WITH YOU.

864
02:18:36,975 --> 02:18:38,267
-BYE.
-I GOTTA KNOW--

865
02:18:42,314 --> 02:18:43,897
-SO?
-WE GOT A DEAL.

866
02:18:49,029 --> 02:18:51,280
-TO A VERY SMOOTH TALKER.
-YEAH.

867
02:18:51,448 --> 02:18:54,074
-MAZEL.
- AT LEAST.

868
02:18:54,242 --> 02:18:56,869
-PEGGELEH.
-NOODLES.

869
02:19:01,916 --> 02:19:03,959
WHERE'S THAT SWITCH LIST?

870
02:19:04,127 --> 02:19:06,545
- THE SWITCH LIST?
-YEAH.

871
02:19:07,881 --> 02:19:09,590
-I CAN'T FIND IT.
- WHAT?

872
02:19:09,758 --> 02:19:11,842
I CAN'T FIND IT.

873
02:19:12,802 --> 02:19:15,846
-WHAT'D YOU DO WITH IT?
-I THINK I DUMPED IT WITH THAT JACKET.

874
02:19:16,014 --> 02:19:17,598
WHAT A YUTZ.

875
02:19:17,766 --> 02:19:19,933
- OH, PAT.
- WAIT A MINUTE, LISTEN.

876
02:19:20,101 --> 02:19:22,936
LISTEN, NOODLES,
NOODLES, WAIT. I REMEMBER.

877
02:19:23,104 --> 02:19:27,024
THE BOYS' NUMBERS WAS ODD-- WAS EVEN,
AND THE GIRLS' NUMBERS WAS ODD.

878
02:19:27,192 --> 02:19:29,318
-THAT'S VERY SIMPLE.
-YOU TOOK GOOD STOCK.

879
02:19:29,486 --> 02:19:31,737
HEY, KNOW WHAT?
LET'S GIVE HIM AN EVEN NUMBER.

880
02:19:31,905 --> 02:19:34,239
UH, EIGHT. LET'S PICK AN EIGHT.

881
02:19:34,491 --> 02:19:35,616
EIGHT.

882
02:19:38,495 --> 02:19:40,037
YEAH, IT'S A GOOD NUMBER.

883
02:19:40,205 --> 02:19:43,082
WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT ABOUT
THE OTHER LITTLE PISCHERS?

884
02:19:44,042 --> 02:19:46,126
WE'RE BETTER THAN FATE.

885
02:19:46,294 --> 02:19:49,171
WE GIVE SOME THE GOOD LIFE,
GIVE IT TO OTHERS UP THE ASS.

886
02:19:52,342 --> 02:19:55,803
ALL RIGHT, BOYS, LET'S SETTLE UP.
IT'S SATURDAY.

887
02:19:55,970 --> 02:19:59,264
SETTLE-SHMETTLE, PEGGY,
I'M GONNA TAKE MINE OUT IN TRADE.

888
02:19:59,432 --> 02:20:00,808
OH, YOU'RE SUCH A NUDGE.

889
02:20:02,477 --> 02:20:06,647
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WISH I WAS SWITCHED WHEN I WAS A KID.

890
02:20:06,815 --> 02:20:08,565
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU WEREN'T?

891
02:20:24,582 --> 02:20:26,708
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

892
02:20:27,377 --> 02:20:31,255
HEY, YOU GUYS, COME HERE.
TAKE A LOOK AT WHO'S OVER HERE.

893
02:20:31,423 --> 02:20:33,715
-THAT SUIT YOU, PEG?
- OKAY, FINE, MAX.

894
02:20:33,883 --> 02:20:36,427
-WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?
-OVER THERE.

895
02:20:38,888 --> 02:20:40,806
WELL, WHAT--?

896
02:20:46,062 --> 02:20:50,232
HOLY SHIT! NOODLES, NOODLES!
COME HERE, COME HERE.

897
02:20:50,400 --> 02:20:52,067
LOOK.

898
02:20:54,070 --> 02:20:56,488
THE BLOND BY THE PIANO.

899
02:20:59,993 --> 02:21:02,119
-YEAH, WHO'S THAT? YEAH.
-WHO'S THAT?

900
02:21:02,287 --> 02:21:04,329
YOU AND THIS BROAD WERE
PRACTICALLY ENGAGED.

901
02:21:04,497 --> 02:21:05,664
OOH.

902
02:21:05,832 --> 02:21:10,878
BEAT ME. OOH, BEAT ME. OOH, I LOVE IT.
HA, HA.

903
02:21:11,045 --> 02:21:13,547
-WHO WAS IT? THE DETROIT COCK-SQUASHER?
- YEAH.

904
02:21:13,715 --> 02:21:16,091
- PEGGY.
- NOT HER, SHE LOOKS DIFFERENT.

905
02:21:16,259 --> 02:21:19,595
YOU KNOW THAT PLATINUM BLOND
IN THE FLOWER DRESS? SHE'S BY THE TABLE.

906
02:21:19,762 --> 02:21:22,181
SEE HER? CALL HER IN, WILL YOU?

907
02:21:28,813 --> 02:21:30,272
-CAROL.
-CAROL, WHATEVER.

908
02:21:30,440 --> 02:21:34,443
JUST TELL HER THERE'S A BUNCH OF HER
OLD FRIENDS HERE, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

909
02:21:36,154 --> 02:21:37,738
CAROL.

910
02:21:37,906 --> 02:21:39,781
CAROL!

911
02:21:44,787 --> 02:21:47,164
NOODLES, PFFT, COME HERE.

912
02:21:50,376 --> 02:21:53,795
-SOMEBODY HERE WANTS TO SEE YOU.
-WHO?

913
02:21:54,547 --> 02:21:56,256
YOU KNOW THESE GUYS?

914
02:21:58,676 --> 02:22:00,552
NO.

915
02:22:01,971 --> 02:22:04,431
I DON'T THINK SO.

916
02:22:08,269 --> 02:22:09,770
NO. HA, HA.

917
02:22:09,938 --> 02:22:13,732
NO. I'D REMEMBER A BUNCH
OF GOOD-LOOKERS LIKE THESE.

918
02:22:31,251 --> 02:22:34,920
OH, WELL, HOW COULD I FORGET?

919
02:22:41,177 --> 02:22:43,554
THERE WAS, UH....

920
02:22:43,721 --> 02:22:49,351
THERE WAS ONLY ONE OF YOU
I GOT TO KNOW PERSONALLY, THOUGH.

921
02:22:51,104 --> 02:22:52,813
WHICH ONE?

922
02:22:52,981 --> 02:22:56,233
LET'S SEE HOW GOOD
A MEMORY YOU'VE GOT FOR FACES.

923
02:23:16,546 --> 02:23:18,964
YOU.

924
02:23:19,132 --> 02:23:21,049
NO.

925
02:23:21,301 --> 02:23:22,551
HIM.

926
02:23:22,719 --> 02:23:26,305
WE'VE BEEN HANGING OUT SO LONG
TOGETHER, WE'RE STARTING TO LOOK ALIKE.

927
02:23:26,472 --> 02:23:28,473
"HANGING OUT"?

928
02:23:38,693 --> 02:23:41,320
CHARMED.

929
02:23:58,546 --> 02:24:00,547
YOU CAN CALL ME CAROL.

930
02:24:12,060 --> 02:24:14,311
WE'VE ALREADY MET.

931
02:24:32,538 --> 02:24:34,623
PLEASURE.

932
02:24:35,667 --> 02:24:37,793
THE PLEASURE...

933
02:24:37,960 --> 02:24:40,212
...IS ALL MINE.

934
02:24:50,348 --> 02:24:53,058
MMM.

935
02:25:07,198 --> 02:25:10,075
SO YOU LEFT DETROIT, HUH?

936
02:25:10,243 --> 02:25:12,744
NO, HER AND HER HUSBAND
JUST COME IN ON THE WEEKENDS.

937
02:25:12,912 --> 02:25:15,163
YEAH, IT BEATS THE SEASHORE.

938
02:25:16,124 --> 02:25:20,210
WELL, SHE TAKES ON MAYBE 10 GUYS AND
HER HUBBY WATCHES THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE.

939
02:25:20,378 --> 02:25:22,504
BEATS THE HELL OUT OF THE MOVIES.

940
02:25:22,672 --> 02:25:25,298
I WONDER WHAT THAT JERK IS UP TO
IN HIS CUBBYHOLE NOW.

941
02:25:25,466 --> 02:25:27,759
HE MUST BE WONDERING,
WHERE IS HIS FUCKING WIFE?

942
02:25:35,810 --> 02:25:39,604
WHY DON'T WE MAKE IT A THREESOME, HUH?

943
02:25:39,772 --> 02:25:42,899
CAN'T YOU SEE HE'S GOT
OTHER PLANS FOR TONIGHT?

944
02:25:43,067 --> 02:25:47,154
WELL, BRING HER ALONG.
WE'LL MAKE IT A FOURSOME.

945
02:25:51,451 --> 02:25:54,619
I'M NOT THAT KIND OF GUY.

946
02:25:54,787 --> 02:25:59,624
BESIDES, I'M AFRAID IF I GIVE YOU A GOOD
CRACK IN THE MOUTH, YOU'D PROBABLY LIKE IT.

947
02:26:13,014 --> 02:26:15,474
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT, FELLAS.

948
02:26:16,100 --> 02:26:18,059
SEE YOU LATER.

949
02:26:31,157 --> 02:26:34,242
-BEEN WAITING LONG?
-ALL MY LIFE.

950
02:26:54,514 --> 02:26:59,017
YOU WANTED A PLACE BY THE OCEAN SO I HAD
IT OPENED. IT WAS CLOSED FOR THE SEASON.

951
02:26:59,185 --> 02:27:01,978
ALL THESE TABLES ARE FOR TWO PEOPLE.

952
02:27:02,313 --> 02:27:04,773
PICK WHATEVER ONE YOU WANT.

953
02:27:36,305 --> 02:27:37,931
I LIKE THIS ONE.

954
02:27:38,099 --> 02:27:40,225
HERE, SIT DOWN.

955
02:27:49,694 --> 02:27:53,321
OH, I'LL HAVE THE ASPERGES SAUCE
VINAIGRETTE AND THEN A CHÂTEAUBRIAND.

956
02:27:56,784 --> 02:27:58,660
I'LL DECIDE LATER.

957
02:27:58,828 --> 02:28:01,413
-MONSIEUR?
-I'LL HAVE THE SAME.

958
02:28:02,498 --> 02:28:04,332
FOR THE WINE?

959
02:28:04,500 --> 02:28:06,751
YOU DECIDE.
I'LL JUST HAVE WATER.

960
02:28:06,919 --> 02:28:10,881
-YOU DECIDE.
-THANK YOU.

961
02:28:18,180 --> 02:28:19,639
YOU'VE BEEN AROUND.

962
02:28:20,808 --> 02:28:24,144
WHERE'D YOU LEARN ALL THEM
"PARLEZ-VOUS FRANÇAIS" DISHES?

963
02:28:24,312 --> 02:28:25,812
WHO'S TEACHING YOU THAT STUFF?

964
02:28:27,189 --> 02:28:30,442
YOU MEAN A SUGAR DADDY
WHO TRIES TO TEACH ME HOW TO ACT?

965
02:28:32,862 --> 02:28:34,404
I READ BOOKS. I LEARN EVERYTHING.

966
02:28:34,572 --> 02:28:38,241
I WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING.
DOESN'T IT MAKE SENSE TO HAVE PLANS?

967
02:28:39,577 --> 02:28:41,828
YEAH, IT DOES.

968
02:28:42,330 --> 02:28:45,540
WHAT ABOUT ME? AM I IN THESE PLANS?

969
02:28:47,668 --> 02:28:49,377
NOODLES....

970
02:28:50,796 --> 02:28:54,341
YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON THAT I HAVE EVER--

971
02:28:54,508 --> 02:28:57,677
EVER WHAT? GO AHEAD.

972
02:28:59,096 --> 02:29:01,097
EVER WHAT?

973
02:29:01,682 --> 02:29:04,225
THAT I EVER CARED ABOUT.

974
02:29:04,602 --> 02:29:08,271
BUT YOU'D LOCK ME UP AND YOU'D
THROW AWAY THE KEY, WOULDN'T YOU?

975
02:29:12,777 --> 02:29:14,611
YEAH.

976
02:29:15,279 --> 02:29:17,364
YEAH, I GUESS SO.

977
02:29:17,531 --> 02:29:19,658
YEAH.

978
02:29:19,825 --> 02:29:23,119
AND THE THING IS,
I PROBABLY WOULDN'T EVEN MIND.

979
02:29:25,456 --> 02:29:30,293
-SO?
-SO I GOT TO GET TO WHERE I'M GOING.

980
02:29:30,461 --> 02:29:33,254
-AND WHERE'S THAT?
-TO THE TOP.

981
02:29:36,968 --> 02:29:39,719
NOW YOU SOUND JUST LIKE MAXIE.

982
02:29:40,262 --> 02:29:43,640
YOUSE ARE BOTH ALIKE,
THAT'S WHY YOU HATE EACH OTHER SO MUCH.

983
02:29:43,808 --> 02:29:46,017
DO YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE?

984
02:29:51,065 --> 02:29:53,608
NO, I DON'T WANT YOU TO LEAVE.

985
02:30:16,340 --> 02:30:18,591
YOU DANCING?

986
02:30:19,093 --> 02:30:20,719
-YOU ASKING?
-I'M ASKING.

987
02:30:20,886 --> 02:30:22,971
I'M DANCING.

988
02:31:35,753 --> 02:31:40,465
TO KEEP FROM GOING CRAZY,
YOU HAVE TO CUT YOURSELF OFF FROM THE WORLD.

989
02:31:40,633 --> 02:31:43,259
JUST NOT THINK ABOUT IT.
YOU HAVE TO, UH....

990
02:31:43,427 --> 02:31:46,721
YOU KNOW, YEARS THAT WENT BY,
IT SEEMED LIKE...

991
02:31:46,889 --> 02:31:50,183
...NO TIME AT ALL,
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING.

992
02:31:50,351 --> 02:31:53,895
BUT THERE WERE TWO THINGS I COULDN'T
GET OUT OF MY MIND. ONE WAS DOMINIC.

993
02:31:54,063 --> 02:31:57,607
THE WAY HE SAID "I SLIPPED"
JUST BEFORE HE DIED.

994
02:31:58,901 --> 02:32:01,152
THE OTHER WAS YOU.

995
02:32:07,368 --> 02:32:11,579
HOW YOU USED TO READ ME
YOUR SONG OF SONGS, REMEMBER?

996
02:32:13,374 --> 02:32:17,836
HOW BEAUTIFUL ARE YOUR FEET
IN SANDALS, O PRINCE'S DAUGHTER.

997
02:32:21,465 --> 02:32:26,636
I USED TO READ THE BIBLE EVERY NIGHT.
EVERY NIGHT I USED TO THINK ABOUT YOU.

998
02:32:28,889 --> 02:32:33,601
YOUR NAVEL IS A BOWL,
WELL-ROUNDED WITH NO LACK OF WINE.

999
02:32:33,769 --> 02:32:37,647
YOUR BELLY, A HEAP OF WHEAT
SURROUNDED WITH LILIES.

1000
02:32:37,815 --> 02:32:40,233
YOUR BREASTS...

1001
02:32:41,777 --> 02:32:44,237
...CLUSTERS OF GRAPES.

1002
02:32:44,947 --> 02:32:49,284
YOUR BREATH, SWEET-SCENTED AS APPLES.

1003
02:32:56,876 --> 02:32:59,961
NOBODY'S GONNA LOVE YOU
THE WAY I LOVED YOU.

1004
02:33:04,466 --> 02:33:07,969
THERE WERE TIMES I COULDN'T STAND IT
ANYMORE. I USED TO THINK ABOUT YOU.

1005
02:33:08,137 --> 02:33:12,223
I'D THINK, "DEBORAH LIVES.
SHE'S OUT THERE. SHE EXISTS."

1006
02:33:12,391 --> 02:33:14,893
AND THAT WOULD GET ME THROUGH IT ALL.

1007
02:33:17,438 --> 02:33:19,981
YOU KNOW HOW IMPORTANT
THAT WAS TO ME?

1008
02:33:26,238 --> 02:33:28,865
NOODLES, I'M LEAVING TOMORROW
TO GO TO HOLLYWOOD.

1009
02:33:29,033 --> 02:33:31,826
I WANTED TO SEE YOU TONIGHT
TO TELL YOU.

1010
02:35:25,941 --> 02:35:27,608
NO.

1011
02:35:28,068 --> 02:35:29,652
NO! I--

1012
02:35:30,279 --> 02:35:33,072
NO! NO. AH!

1013
02:35:36,702 --> 02:35:41,789
NO. PLEASE, NO. NO, PLEASE. NO!

1014
02:35:41,957 --> 02:35:47,253
NO! OH, NO! NO, PLEASE!

1015
02:35:47,421 --> 02:35:52,592
NO, NO! PLEASE, NO, NO. NO.

1016
02:35:55,888 --> 02:35:57,638
NO!

1017
02:37:32,526 --> 02:37:34,193
DEBORAH. DEBORAH.

1018
02:37:34,361 --> 02:37:36,737
GET AWAY! GET AWAY!

1019
02:37:53,672 --> 02:37:55,631
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

1020
02:38:27,372 --> 02:38:29,165
TAKE HER HOME.

1021
02:38:30,083 --> 02:38:31,918
TAKE HER HOME.

1022
02:40:05,178 --> 02:40:07,805
ALL ABOARD!

1023
02:42:28,488 --> 02:42:30,030
WELL...

1024
02:42:30,699 --> 02:42:32,908
...LOOK WHO'S BACK.

1025
02:42:34,202 --> 02:42:35,953
WHAT'S THIS?

1026
02:42:39,458 --> 02:42:41,208
IT'S A THRONE.

1027
02:42:43,378 --> 02:42:45,755
IT WAS A GIFT TO A POPE.

1028
02:42:46,631 --> 02:42:51,010
-COST ME 800 BUCKS.
-IT'S FROM THE 17TH CENTURY.

1029
02:43:00,270 --> 02:43:02,730
SO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH IT?

1030
02:43:05,567 --> 02:43:07,443
I'M SITTING ON IT.

1031
02:43:15,744 --> 02:43:18,913
-YOU GOT ANY COFFEE AROUND?
- YEAH, SURE.

1032
02:43:30,759 --> 02:43:32,426
THANKS.

1033
02:44:47,335 --> 02:44:48,836
HM.

1034
02:44:50,338 --> 02:44:55,092
WHILE YOU WERE ON VACATION,
WE WERE WORKING OVERTIME.

1035
02:45:02,267 --> 02:45:04,393
THE UNION PAID OFF.

1036
02:45:07,272 --> 02:45:09,315
THAT'S YOUR SHARE.

1037
02:45:10,442 --> 02:45:14,737
YEAH. EVEN THAT GEEK.
YOU KNOW, JIMMY "CLEAN HANDS"...

1038
02:45:14,905 --> 02:45:20,701
...RESPECTS US.
EH, I SHED A LITTLE BLOOD FOR THE CAUSE.

1039
02:45:20,869 --> 02:45:23,287
YEAH, IT'S ALL IN THE PAPERS.

1040
02:45:23,455 --> 02:45:27,583
MORNING TELEGRAPH, THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT.

1041
02:45:27,751 --> 02:45:32,588
IT SAYS, "UNDERWORLD JOINS STRIKERS
IN BRUTAL BATTLE."

1042
02:45:32,756 --> 02:45:36,550
BUT THE POST, THEY LIKED IT.

1043
02:45:36,718 --> 02:45:40,429
"ENDS JUSTIFY MEANS
IN DECISIVE GANGLAND ENCOUNTER."

1044
02:45:40,847 --> 02:45:43,766
AND THEY'RE THE ONES THAT KVETCHED
ABOUT THE ATLANTIC CITY JOB.

1045
02:45:43,934 --> 02:45:47,937
HEH. NEWSPAPER GUYS NEVER KNOW
WHAT THE FUCK THEY WANT.

1046
02:45:54,861 --> 02:45:58,238
-WELL, YOU COULD HAVE LOOKED FOR ME.
- WE DID.

1047
02:45:59,574 --> 02:46:02,034
COCKEYE FOUND YOU AT THE CHINK'S.

1048
02:46:02,202 --> 02:46:04,954
SO FUCKING DOPED UP
YOU DIDN'T EVEN RECOGNIZE HIM.

1049
02:46:05,163 --> 02:46:10,334
YEAH, YOU WERE. HEH.
YOU CALLED ME "DEBORAH." HA-HA-HA.

1050
02:46:12,087 --> 02:46:14,421
HEY, GO FUCK YOURSELF.
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

1051
02:46:14,589 --> 02:46:18,884
WE DO OUR BUSINESS TOGETHER
AND FUCKING BROADS DO NOT GET IN THE WAY...

1052
02:46:19,052 --> 02:46:20,344
-...AND YOU KNOW IT!
- YEAH?

1053
02:46:20,512 --> 02:46:22,763
-YEAH.
-THEN WHAT'S SHE DOING HERE?

1054
02:46:24,057 --> 02:46:27,977
TODAY AIN'T SATURDAY. SHE SHOULD BE IN
DETROIT, SCREWING ON THE ASSEMBLY LINE.

1055
02:46:28,144 --> 02:46:30,771
WELL, SHE'S SCREWING HERE NOW.

1056
02:46:30,939 --> 02:46:34,650
AND ONLY WITH MAX.

1057
02:46:35,276 --> 02:46:37,236
OH, YEAH?

1058
02:46:37,404 --> 02:46:41,991
-WITH HER HUSBAND PEEPING THROUGH?
-NO, I LEFT HIM.

1059
02:46:46,037 --> 02:46:49,790
YOU LIVE WITH HER, BRING HER HERE,
AND YOU TELL ME NOT TO MESS WITH BROADS.

1060
02:46:49,958 --> 02:46:51,709
-YOU FORGET ONE THING.
- WHAT?

1061
02:46:51,876 --> 02:46:54,044
-I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT HER.
-MAX--

1062
02:46:54,212 --> 02:46:57,464
- SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHH!
- MAXIE, TELL ME SOMETHING.

1063
02:46:57,632 --> 02:46:59,466
WHAT'LL YOU SPEND YOUR HONEYMOON ON?

1064
02:46:59,634 --> 02:47:03,679
-MAXIE--
SHUT THE FUCK UP! SHUT UP!

1065
02:47:04,973 --> 02:47:07,057
JUST SHUT UP!

1066
02:47:11,521 --> 02:47:13,522
YOU WANT ME TO DUMP HER?

1067
02:47:13,982 --> 02:47:15,899
YOU WANT ME TO KICK HER
OUT OF HERE?

1068
02:47:17,986 --> 02:47:20,320
WANT ME TO KICK HER ASS OUT OR WHAT?

1069
02:47:20,488 --> 02:47:25,242
YOU WANT ME TO KICK--? GET THE FUCK OUT!
GET THE FUCK OUT! GET OUT!

1070
02:47:32,292 --> 02:47:35,127
YOU GONNA TELL ME I DON'T HAVE
A WAY WITH WOMEN? HA-HA-HA.

1071
02:47:47,974 --> 02:47:50,476
-HELLO.
- THIS IS JIMMY. WHO'S THIS, MAX?

1072
02:47:50,643 --> 02:47:52,686
NO, IT'S NOODLES.

1073
02:47:55,023 --> 02:47:59,026
OKAY, LISTEN.
WE'RE GONNA NEED YOU GUYS TODAY.

1074
02:47:59,194 --> 02:48:02,446
I'M GONNA BE MAKING
A TOUGH SPEECH, AND I THINK YOU--

1075
02:48:13,083 --> 02:48:15,125
GO, GO!

1076
02:48:36,397 --> 02:48:39,650
START THE ENGINE.
I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU.

1077
02:48:39,818 --> 02:48:44,071
MR. GALLAGHER WANTS YOU TO KNOW
HOW MUCH HE APPRECIATES WHAT YOU DID.

1078
02:48:44,239 --> 02:48:46,657
TO SHOW HIS APPRECIATION....

1079
02:48:57,085 --> 02:49:00,212
HERE'S AN ENVELOPE
FOR THE BOTH OF YOUSE.

1080
02:49:00,380 --> 02:49:05,092
IF WE GOTTA COMPLETE THE JOB,
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

1081
02:49:41,212 --> 02:49:42,379
WHOA! WHOA!

1082
02:49:42,797 --> 02:49:44,923
WIPED OUT BY A BLAST OF CORDON ROUGE.

1083
02:49:45,091 --> 02:49:47,718
WHAT WOULD CROWNING
AND HIS BOSSES SAY AFTER THAT, EH?

1084
02:49:47,886 --> 02:49:50,804
NEVER BE AFRAID OF YOU, THEN,
WOULD THEY?

1085
02:49:50,972 --> 02:49:55,726
THEY'RE STILL NOT AFRAID OF ME.
IT WAS YOU BOYS THAT SCARED THEM OFF.

1086
02:49:55,977 --> 02:50:00,355
AND YOU DIDN'T WANT THESE GUYS.
AREN'T YOU LUCKY YOU GOT PARTY LEADERS...

1087
02:50:00,523 --> 02:50:02,816
...LIKE MYSELF WHO CARE ABOUT THE UNION?

1088
02:50:02,984 --> 02:50:07,321
HEY, THE STRIKE IS SETTLED. WE WON.
THAT'S WHAT COUNTS. AM I RIGHT, JIM?

1089
02:50:07,488 --> 02:50:11,283
IT WAS TOUGH FOR JIMMY NOT TO BE THERE
TO SIGN THE CONTRACT THOUGH, HUH, JIM?

1090
02:50:11,451 --> 02:50:12,993
NO.

1091
02:50:14,662 --> 02:50:19,499
WHAT'S TOUGH IS, YOU BOYS DID MORE IN
A NIGHT THAN I COULD IN TWO YEARS OF TALKING.

1092
02:50:19,667 --> 02:50:21,877
- FORGET IT.
- TO THE HOTTEST NEWCOMER...

1093
02:50:22,045 --> 02:50:24,046
-...IN AMERICAN UNIONS.
- THERE YOU GO.

1094
02:50:24,214 --> 02:50:26,298
- JIMMY CONWAY.
- NOW YOU'RE TALKING.

1095
02:50:26,466 --> 02:50:27,883
ROLL OUT THE BARREL.

1096
02:50:28,051 --> 02:50:32,346
- MAY GOD BLESS.
- DRINK UP. SUCK IT RIGHT DOWN.

1097
02:50:32,513 --> 02:50:36,308
YOU MUST BE CRAZY GIVING
HIM DRINKS. WE'RE GOING TO OPERATE.

1098
02:50:36,476 --> 02:50:41,438
OH, WHAT'S THE RUSH? THEY ALREADY TOLD ME
I'D BE A GIMP FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

1099
02:50:41,606 --> 02:50:46,777
DON'T WORRY, JIMMY, WITH ONE LEG
A LITTLE SHY, YOU'RE GONNA TAKE GIANT STEPS.

1100
02:50:46,945 --> 02:50:51,073
YEAH. AND ALWAYS ONE STEP
RIGHT BEHIND YOU, SHARKEY?

1101
02:50:51,241 --> 02:50:53,951
MAKE SURE THEY WORK ON
THE RIGHT LEG, JIM.

1102
02:50:54,118 --> 02:50:56,411
-IT'S ONLY BLOOD, HUH?
-MAZEL.

1103
02:51:04,295 --> 02:51:09,299
YOU BOYS GOT YOURSELF A REAL MARTYR
FOR A FRIEND. MAKE IT WORK FOR YOU.

1104
02:51:09,467 --> 02:51:12,678
YEAH, BUT WHAT THE HELL ARE WE
GONNA DO WITH A MARTYR?

1105
02:51:12,845 --> 02:51:17,057
TIMES CHANGE. PROHIBITION AIN'T GONNA
LAST MUCH LONGER. TAKE IT FROM ME...

1106
02:51:17,225 --> 02:51:23,563
-...A LOT OF YOU GUYS WILL BE OUT OF WORK.
-GO ON, MR. SHARKEY. WE'RE INTERESTED.

1107
02:51:24,983 --> 02:51:28,527
YOU EVER THINK OF SETTING
YOURSELVES UP IN BUSINESS?

1108
02:51:28,903 --> 02:51:33,657
ALL THOSE TRUCKS THEY'RE USING TO HAUL
LIQUOR, SOON BE SELLING THEM FOR NOTHING.

1109
02:51:33,825 --> 02:51:39,079
I'M TALKING ABOUT HUNDREDS OF VEHICLES
CONTROLLED BY A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION...

1110
02:51:39,247 --> 02:51:42,833
...AND SUPPORTED BY A POWERFUL UNION
HEADED BY JIMMY CONWAY.

1111
02:51:43,001 --> 02:51:47,087
WHATEVER YOU ASK,
THERE'S NO WAY HE CAN TURN YOU DOWN.

1112
02:51:47,755 --> 02:51:49,798
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING, SHARKEY.

1113
02:51:52,010 --> 02:51:55,345
JIMMY "CLEAN HANDS"
IN BUSINESS WITH US?

1114
02:51:55,972 --> 02:51:59,474
THEY WON'T BE CLEAN FOR LONG,
WITH THE HANDS HE'S GONNA SHAKE.

1115
02:51:59,642 --> 02:52:02,269
EVERYTHING IN GOOD TIME.

1116
02:52:17,118 --> 02:52:21,121
-WE'RE NOT INTERESTED.
-WHAT'S THE MATTER, YOU GOT A PROBLEM?

1117
02:52:21,289 --> 02:52:24,958
WE GOT PLENTY OF MONEY TUCKED AWAY.
WHY NOT INVEST IT? WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?

1118
02:52:25,126 --> 02:52:29,421
I'LL PUT THE PARTY BEHIND YOU.
AND I GOT FRIENDS IN HIGH PLACES.

1119
02:52:30,965 --> 02:52:34,217
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR FRIENDS,
AND I DON'T TRUST POLITICIANS.

1120
02:52:34,385 --> 02:52:36,970
YOU STILL THINK LIKE
SOME SCHMUCK FROM THE STREETS.

1121
02:52:37,138 --> 02:52:40,098
IF WE'D LISTENED TO YOU,
WE'D STILL BE ROLLING DRUNKS.

1122
02:52:40,266 --> 02:52:42,601
-ARE YOU BROKE?
-DON'T BUST MY BALLS.

1123
02:52:42,769 --> 02:52:45,812
I AM TALKING ABOUT REAL MONEY.

1124
02:52:46,314 --> 02:52:51,985
THIS IS REAL MONEY TO ME. IT'S A LOT
OF MONEY. YOU WANT ANY OF IT?

1125
02:52:52,445 --> 02:52:56,865
-YOU CARRY THAT STINK OF THE STREETS.
-I LIKE THE STINK. IT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD.

1126
02:52:57,033 --> 02:53:00,535
I LIKE THE SMELL OF IT.
IT OPENS UP MY LUNGS.

1127
02:53:01,245 --> 02:53:03,330
AND IT GIVES ME A HARD-ON.

1128
02:53:03,498 --> 02:53:05,832
YOU'RE CARRYING DEAD WEIGHT, MAXIE.

1129
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:09,252
ONE OF THESE DAYS,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DUMP IT.

1130
02:53:12,882 --> 02:53:15,675
MAXIE. LET ME KNOW
WHEN YOU'RE GONNA DUMP ME.

1131
02:53:15,843 --> 02:53:19,429
MEANWHILE, I'LL TAKE A VACATION IN FLORIDA.
I GOT A YEN FOR THE SEASHORE.

1132
02:53:42,412 --> 02:53:44,121
HEY.

1133
02:53:45,998 --> 02:53:48,875
LISTEN, I WAS THINKING IT OVER AND, UM....

1134
02:53:50,211 --> 02:53:54,256
I GUESS I KIND OF GOT A YEN
FOR THE SEASHORE MYSELF.

1135
02:53:59,887 --> 02:54:01,471
YOU WANNA GO SWIMMING?

1136
02:54:02,348 --> 02:54:06,518
YEAH. YEAH, LET'S GO FOR A SWIM.

1137
02:54:23,327 --> 02:54:26,955
READ ALL ABOUT IT! READ ALL ABOUT IT!

1138
02:54:28,916 --> 02:54:31,418
READ ALL ABOUT IT!

1139
02:55:45,993 --> 02:55:47,953
HEY, MAXIE.

1140
02:55:48,538 --> 02:55:50,914
-MAX.
-HUH?

1141
02:55:51,082 --> 02:55:53,833
HOW MUCH MONEY WE GOT PUT AWAY?

1142
02:55:54,085 --> 02:55:55,502
WHY?

1143
02:55:58,339 --> 02:56:00,757
BECAUSE WE'RE UNEMPLOYED.

1144
02:56:15,815 --> 02:56:18,316
ABOUT A MILLION BUCKS.

1145
02:56:18,818 --> 02:56:23,530
-OH, YEAH? WHERE'D YOU PUT IT?
-IN MY UNDERWEAR.

1146
02:56:25,658 --> 02:56:29,369
-I'D HAVE FOUND IT THERE.
-HEY.

1147
02:56:29,704 --> 02:56:31,288
HUH?

1148
02:56:56,564 --> 02:57:01,109
WE GOTTA REORGANIZE, MAX.
AND I GOT A COUPLE OF GOOD IDEAS.

1149
02:57:02,486 --> 02:57:04,195
ME TOO.

1150
02:57:04,488 --> 02:57:07,532
IF I HAD A MILLION BUCKS,
I'D TAKE IT EASY.

1151
02:57:07,700 --> 02:57:10,076
WE'LL TAKE IT EASY WHEN WE GOT 20.

1152
02:57:11,454 --> 02:57:14,789
-FIFTY.
- WHERE YOU GONNA GET THAT?

1153
02:57:18,127 --> 02:57:19,794
RIGHT HERE.

1154
02:57:29,138 --> 02:57:30,889
WHAT'S THAT?

1155
02:57:34,310 --> 02:57:36,227
IT'S A DREAM.

1156
02:57:38,648 --> 02:57:41,399
A DREAM I'VE BEEN DREAMING
ALL MY LIFE.

1157
02:57:41,567 --> 02:57:45,695
I SWEAR TO GOD, NOODLES, YOU AND ME
TOGETHER, WE CAN MAKE IT COME TRUE.

1158
02:57:49,617 --> 02:57:50,825
WHAT IS IT?

1159
02:57:56,123 --> 02:57:57,957
THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK.

1160
02:58:01,671 --> 02:58:05,131
IT'S THE BIGGEST STEP
WE CAN TAKE, NOODLES.

1161
02:58:28,197 --> 02:58:30,031
YOU'RE REALLY CRAZY.

1162
02:58:31,242 --> 02:58:35,912
DON'T YOU EVER SAY THAT TO ME.
DON'T YOU EVER SAY THAT TO ME AGAIN!

1163
03:00:01,665 --> 03:00:06,544
WHAT CHANCE IS THERE THAT
A CRAZY THING LIKE THIS MIGHT SUCCEED, HM?

1164
03:00:07,755 --> 03:00:09,672
DON'T ASK ME, ASK MAX.

1165
03:00:10,090 --> 03:00:15,929
YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO THAT THIS IS
SUICIDE, PURE AND SIMPLE, FOR EVERYONE.

1166
03:00:16,680 --> 03:00:22,101
YEAH, WELL, DON'T TELL ME, TELL HIM.
YOU GOT YOUR OWN METHODS.

1167
03:00:22,728 --> 03:00:24,896
YEAH, I TRIED.

1168
03:00:25,356 --> 03:00:28,441
HE DOESN'T WANT TO SCREW ANYMORE.

1169
03:00:31,403 --> 03:00:34,739
ALL HE THINKS ABOUT IS THIS JOB.

1170
03:00:37,243 --> 03:00:40,328
TEAR GAS, HOSTAGES,
NOW HE'S GONNA DO THIS.

1171
03:00:40,496 --> 03:00:43,915
HE'S GONNA DO IT WITH OR WITHOUT YOU.

1172
03:00:49,171 --> 03:00:52,590
NOODLES, WE'VE NEVER LIKED EACH OTHER.

1173
03:00:56,887 --> 03:01:02,517
WE PUT UP WITH EACH OTHER FOR MAX'S SAKE.
SO WHY DON'T WE JUST GET TOGETHER ONCE...

1174
03:01:02,685 --> 03:01:05,436
...AND DO SOMETHING FOR HIM?

1175
03:01:15,155 --> 03:01:17,115
AND AFTER THAT...

1176
03:01:18,158 --> 03:01:21,327
...WE CAN GO BACK TO BEING ENEMIES.

1177
03:01:29,837 --> 03:01:34,883
YOU KNOW,
IF YOU WERE ALL IN JAIL FIRST...

1178
03:01:35,050 --> 03:01:38,136
...THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY BANK JOB.

1179
03:01:49,690 --> 03:01:52,358
I GOT THE IDEA FROM YOUR FRIEND MAX.

1180
03:01:54,194 --> 03:01:55,403
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

1181
03:01:58,490 --> 03:02:01,826
HE LAUGHS AT YOU. HE MAKES FUN OF YOU.

1182
03:02:03,662 --> 03:02:06,956
HE SAYS EVE HAS GOT YOU BY THE BALLS.

1183
03:02:07,124 --> 03:02:11,044
EVERY TIME YOU WALK PAST THIS PLACE,
YOU SHIT IN YOUR PANTS.

1184
03:02:11,211 --> 03:02:15,006
YOU'D DO ANYTHING FOR THE COPS TO PICK
YOU UP SO YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS JOB.

1185
03:02:15,174 --> 03:02:17,258
IS THAT TRUE, HUH?

1186
03:02:29,980 --> 03:02:31,564
WELL, THEN DO IT.

1187
03:02:31,732 --> 03:02:35,026
DO IT. PUT HIM IN JAIL.
PUT HIM IN JAIL. NOT LONG.

1188
03:02:35,194 --> 03:02:39,072
JUST LONG ENOUGH SO HE CAN
GET THE IDEA OUT OF HIS MIND.

1189
03:02:40,866 --> 03:02:45,995
IF YOU CAN'T STAND BEING AWAY
FROM HIM, PUT YOURSELF THERE TOO.

1190
03:02:47,581 --> 03:02:50,500
BETTER OFF THAN BEING DEAD.

1191
03:02:54,922 --> 03:02:57,215
YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

1192
03:03:00,844 --> 03:03:03,680
AND IF YOU DON'T, I WILL.

1193
03:03:07,518 --> 03:03:09,727
GET OUT. TAKE A CAB.

1194
03:03:09,895 --> 03:03:12,772
I'M BUSY. I GOT THINGS TO DO. GET OUT.

1195
03:03:18,320 --> 03:03:19,445
NOODLES?

1196
03:03:20,489 --> 03:03:23,408
MAKE UP YOUR MIND FAST, HUH?

1197
03:04:48,118 --> 03:04:50,203
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

1198
03:04:50,704 --> 03:04:53,206
AREN'T YOU HAVING A GOOD TIME?

1199
03:05:00,005 --> 03:05:02,590
WHY ARE YOU GOING OUT TONIGHT?

1200
03:05:03,133 --> 03:05:06,385
WHY BOTHER NOW THAT PROHIBITION
IS ALMOST OVER?

1201
03:05:08,430 --> 03:05:12,350
EVERYBODY'S SELLING. WE GOT FRIENDS WHO
HAVE A LOT OF BOOZE THEY WANNA GET RID OF...

1202
03:05:12,518 --> 03:05:16,979
...FOR PRACTICALLY NOTHING.
SO WE FIGURE, WHY NOT?

1203
03:05:23,153 --> 03:05:25,947
I'M GONNA BE GONE FOR A WHILE.

1204
03:05:26,240 --> 03:05:29,158
I'LL BE WAITING AT THE HOTEL.

1205
03:05:29,993 --> 03:05:34,122
I LIKE IT WHEN YOU COME HOME
LATE AND WAKE ME UP.

1206
03:05:39,711 --> 03:05:41,921
I'M NOT GONNA BE HOME TONIGHT.

1207
03:05:48,929 --> 03:05:51,514
I'M NOT GONNA BE HOME TOMORROW EITHER.

1208
03:05:51,932 --> 03:05:55,893
I THOUGHT THESE THINGS
ONLY TAKE A COUPLE OF HOURS.

1209
03:06:02,276 --> 03:06:08,197
LADIES AND GENTS, I DRINK TO THE DEMISE
OF FAT MOE'S SPEAKEASY.

1210
03:06:08,490 --> 03:06:10,950
WHO THE HELL WANTS TO DRINK
HERE LEGALLY ANYWAY?

1211
03:06:13,287 --> 03:06:16,789
OKAY. COME ON, MOE, SET THEM UP.
GO ON, GET IN THERE.

1212
03:06:30,179 --> 03:06:31,637
- HERE'S ANOTHER ONE.
- HA-HA-HA.

1213
03:06:31,805 --> 03:06:34,056
HERE'S MUD IN YOUR EYE.

1214
03:06:40,731 --> 03:06:42,231
BOYS.

1215
03:06:45,611 --> 03:06:47,737
LET'S DRINK TO OUR LAST SHIPMENT.

1216
03:06:47,905 --> 03:06:50,740
BECAUSE THERE'S MORE ONBOARD
TONIGHT THAN JUST BOOZE.

1217
03:06:50,908 --> 03:06:56,329
IT'S 10 YEARS OF OUR LIVES. TEN YEARS
THAT WERE REALLY WORTH LIVING.

1218
03:06:56,496 --> 03:06:57,872
YEAH.

1219
03:07:06,048 --> 03:07:07,423
AAH.

1220
03:07:16,350 --> 03:07:18,184
NOODLES.

1221
03:07:19,561 --> 03:07:21,145
NOODLES.

1222
03:07:22,856 --> 03:07:25,441
-L'CHAIM.
-L'CHAIM.

1223
03:07:28,445 --> 03:07:31,030
HOW LONG WILL I HAVE TO WAIT?

1224
03:07:34,701 --> 03:07:38,204
A YEAR AND A HALF, MORE OR LESS.

1225
03:07:39,581 --> 03:07:41,749
SIX MONTHS OFF FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR.

1226
03:07:42,209 --> 03:07:45,044
-WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
-DON'T ASK.

1227
03:09:19,806 --> 03:09:21,640
OPERATOR.

1228
03:09:22,976 --> 03:09:24,143
POLICE, PLEASE.

1229
03:09:30,150 --> 03:09:32,401
FIFTH PRECINCT. SERGEANT HALLORAN.

1230
03:09:35,155 --> 03:09:36,697
HELLO.

1231
03:09:37,657 --> 03:09:40,743
WHO'S SPEAKING? CAN I HELP YOU?

1232
03:09:40,911 --> 03:09:42,912
-HELLO?
-YEAH.

1233
03:09:45,499 --> 03:09:47,249
I GOT A GOOD TIP FOR YOU.

1234
03:10:13,735 --> 03:10:17,530
- YEAH, WHO IS IT?
- YEAH, IT'S MAX. OPEN THE DOOR.

1235
03:10:23,412 --> 03:10:27,456
-WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? YOU SICK?
-NO, I'M FINE.

1236
03:10:27,624 --> 03:10:29,291
YOU DON'T LOOK IT.

1237
03:10:31,420 --> 03:10:34,255
MAYBE YOU'D BETTER
STAY HOME TONIGHT, HUH?

1238
03:10:34,756 --> 03:10:37,675
-WHY?
-HEH.

1239
03:10:40,137 --> 03:10:43,055
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN
WATCHING YOU ALL NIGHT.

1240
03:10:44,558 --> 03:10:47,393
AND YOU'VE BEEN DRINKING LIKE A FISH.

1241
03:10:48,270 --> 03:10:50,688
TRYING TO GET YOUR COURAGE UP?

1242
03:10:54,192 --> 03:10:57,486
WE'RE ONLY BRINGING IN
A SHIPMENT OF BOOZE.

1243
03:10:59,030 --> 03:11:02,241
IT'S GOT SO YOU'RE EVEN
SCARED TO DO THAT.

1244
03:11:03,994 --> 03:11:06,745
MAYBE YOU JUST BETTER
STAY HOME TONIGHT.

1245
03:11:07,789 --> 03:11:09,331
WITH EVE. HEH-HEH-HEH.

1246
03:11:19,676 --> 03:11:24,096
HEY, MAXIE, EVERYWHERE YOU GO,
I GO TOO. REMEMBER THAT.

1247
03:11:33,940 --> 03:11:36,400
MAYBE SHARKEY WAS RIGHT.

1248
03:11:36,568 --> 03:11:39,361
MAYBE I OUGHT TO JUST DUMP YOU.

1249
03:11:48,497 --> 03:11:50,080
YOU'RE REALLY CRAZY.

1250
03:11:50,248 --> 03:11:52,166
NEVER SAY THAT!

1251
03:11:52,626 --> 03:11:55,794
DON'T SAY IT!

1252
03:12:02,594 --> 03:12:06,764
MAX MADE FOOLS OF US, NOODLES.
HE WANTED TO DIE.

1253
03:12:06,932 --> 03:12:09,975
DID YOU KNOW HIS OLD MAN
DIED IN THE NUT HOUSE?

1254
03:12:10,143 --> 03:12:12,978
MAX DIDN'T WANT TO
END UP THE SAME WAY.

1255
03:12:13,188 --> 03:12:17,316
SO HE PUT THE IDEA
IN OUR HEADS TO TIP OFF THE COPS.

1256
03:12:17,484 --> 03:12:22,363
AND WHEN THEY STOPPED THE TRUCK,
MAX STARTED SHOOTING FIRST...

1257
03:12:22,531 --> 03:12:25,824
...JUST TO GET HIMSELF KILLED.

1258
03:12:43,009 --> 03:12:45,344
UH, WHAT IS THIS?

1259
03:12:48,390 --> 03:12:49,557
OPENING NIGHT.

1260
03:12:51,226 --> 03:12:53,936
FIFTEEN YEARS AGO.

1261
03:12:54,104 --> 03:12:56,355
UH, WHO'S THIS?

1262
03:12:58,066 --> 03:13:01,068
PATRON SAINT OF THE PLACE.

1263
03:13:02,445 --> 03:13:04,697
AND SOME ACTRESS.

1264
03:13:05,490 --> 03:13:06,865
DO YOU KNOW HER?

1265
03:13:08,868 --> 03:13:10,411
NO.

1266
03:14:03,548 --> 03:14:05,841
HELLO, DEBORAH.

1267
03:14:13,433 --> 03:14:16,101
AREN'T YOU GONNA SAY ANYTHING?

1268
03:14:22,859 --> 03:14:26,195
WHAT IS SOMEONE
SUPPOSED TO SAY AFTER...

1269
03:14:26,821 --> 03:14:29,865
...MORE THAN 30 YEARS.

1270
03:14:34,996 --> 03:14:40,959
WELL, HOW ABOUT, "HOW YOU DOING?
YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD."

1271
03:14:42,962 --> 03:14:46,131
OR, "I WAS HOPING I'D NEVER
SEE YOU AGAIN."

1272
03:14:48,551 --> 03:14:51,553
I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD.

1273
03:14:52,639 --> 03:14:54,973
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.

1274
03:14:55,141 --> 03:14:58,811
YEAH. AT LEAST YOU RECOGNIZE ME,
THAT'S SOMETHING.

1275
03:14:58,978 --> 03:15:01,980
ACTRESSES HAVE GOOD MEMORIES.

1276
03:15:11,741 --> 03:15:14,076
YOU WANT A DRINK?

1277
03:15:18,289 --> 03:15:20,708
I'M HAVING ONE.

1278
03:15:31,136 --> 03:15:32,177
MARGO?

1279
03:15:33,930 --> 03:15:36,640
-YES, MISS?
- THAT'S ALL FOR NOW. YOU CAN GO.

1280
03:15:36,808 --> 03:15:39,017
ALL RIGHT, MISS.

1281
03:15:43,898 --> 03:15:46,775
SHE CALLED YOU "MISS."

1282
03:15:47,110 --> 03:15:49,528
YOU NEVER GOT MARRIED?

1283
03:15:50,363 --> 03:15:51,989
NO.

1284
03:15:55,577 --> 03:15:57,119
YOU LIVE ALONE?

1285
03:16:05,253 --> 03:16:06,754
NO.

1286
03:16:13,595 --> 03:16:15,929
WHERE WERE YOU?

1287
03:16:18,850 --> 03:16:21,268
I WAS OUT OF TOWN.

1288
03:16:24,105 --> 03:16:26,899
HAVE YOU BEEN BACK LONG?

1289
03:16:27,859 --> 03:16:30,277
A COUPLE OF DAYS.

1290
03:16:30,445 --> 03:16:32,696
ARE YOU STAYING?

1291
03:16:44,334 --> 03:16:45,751
THAT DEPENDS.

1292
03:16:48,671 --> 03:16:50,756
WHY DO YOU WANT TO SEE ME?

1293
03:16:52,592 --> 03:16:54,927
TWO REASONS.

1294
03:16:55,094 --> 03:16:58,347
FIRST, I WANTED TO SEE
IF YOU DID THE RIGHT THING...

1295
03:16:58,515 --> 03:17:00,599
...TURNING ME DOWN
TO BECOME AN ACTRESS.

1296
03:17:04,771 --> 03:17:06,355
WELL?

1297
03:17:09,150 --> 03:17:11,401
YOU DID. YOU'RE TERRIFIC.

1298
03:17:27,168 --> 03:17:30,254
"AGE CANNOT WITHER HER."

1299
03:17:30,463 --> 03:17:33,465
IT'S LIKE THE PLAY
WAS WRITTEN FOR YOU.

1300
03:17:36,928 --> 03:17:39,388
WHAT WAS THE OTHER REASON?

1301
03:17:39,597 --> 03:17:41,890
THE OTHER REASON...

1302
03:17:45,103 --> 03:17:49,439
...IS TO DECIDE WHETHER I SHOULD GO
TO A PARTY TOMORROW NIGHT.

1303
03:17:56,155 --> 03:17:57,698
A PARTY?

1304
03:18:00,994 --> 03:18:03,495
YEAH, ON LONG ISLAND.

1305
03:18:04,998 --> 03:18:08,166
A SECRETARY BAILEY.

1306
03:18:12,005 --> 03:18:14,172
DO YOU KNOW SECRETARY BAILEY?

1307
03:18:16,009 --> 03:18:17,217
NO.

1308
03:18:19,512 --> 03:18:21,972
BUT I WAS INVITED ANYWAY.

1309
03:18:30,315 --> 03:18:33,358
BUT IF YOU DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER,
WHY WERE YOU INVITED?

1310
03:18:33,526 --> 03:18:35,068
I DON'T KNOW.

1311
03:18:36,696 --> 03:18:38,739
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT KNOW WHY.

1312
03:18:39,657 --> 03:18:41,158
ME?

1313
03:18:41,367 --> 03:18:42,993
WHY ME?

1314
03:18:48,416 --> 03:18:50,334
BECAUSE YOU KNOW HIM.

1315
03:18:51,794 --> 03:18:53,253
-WHO IS IT?
- DAVID.

1316
03:18:53,421 --> 03:18:56,089
-NO, DAVID.
- CAN I COME IN?

1317
03:18:56,299 --> 03:18:59,134
NO, NO, NO. JUST WAIT OUTSIDE,
DAVID, I'LL CALL YOU.

1318
03:18:59,344 --> 03:19:01,720
OKAY, I'LL BE RIGHT HERE.

1319
03:19:04,515 --> 03:19:08,310
-WHAT DOES SECRETARY BAILEY WANT FROM ME?
-YOU CAME HERE TO ASK ME THAT?

1320
03:19:08,519 --> 03:19:11,480
-WHY DID HE SEND ME AN INVITATION?
-I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW.

1321
03:19:11,689 --> 03:19:16,026
WHY SHOULD--? WHY SHOULD I KNOW ABOUT
YOUR INVITATIONS? I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING. I--

1322
03:19:16,235 --> 03:19:20,238
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? WHY DID
YOU COME HERE? I KNOW NOTHING, NOTHING.

1323
03:19:20,406 --> 03:19:23,075
NOW YOU'RE A LOUSY ACTRESS.

1324
03:19:25,912 --> 03:19:28,747
WHO IS SECRETARY BAILEY?

1325
03:19:37,507 --> 03:19:41,134
SECRETARY BAILEY IS A RICH BUSINESSMAN.

1326
03:19:46,849 --> 03:19:51,436
HE CAME TO THE UNITED STATES AS A STARVING
IMMIGRANT AND MADE A LOT OF MONEY...

1327
03:19:51,646 --> 03:19:55,607
...IN SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES,
WHERE HE'S LIVED FOR 30 YEARS.

1328
03:19:55,775 --> 03:19:59,778
I KNOW ALL THAT. IT'S ALL IN THE PAPERS.
WHAT ELSE IS THERE?

1329
03:20:06,285 --> 03:20:09,287
HE MARRIED A VERY WEALTHY WOMAN.

1330
03:20:10,581 --> 03:20:12,916
THEY HAD A CHILD.

1331
03:20:13,292 --> 03:20:16,336
SHE DIED WHEN THE CHILD WAS BORN.

1332
03:20:16,921 --> 03:20:21,466
A FEW YEARS AGO, HE WENT INTO POLITICS.
MOVED HERE.

1333
03:20:21,634 --> 03:20:26,263
THAT'S ALL PAST HISTORY. I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT THAT. I'M TALKING ABOUT NOW.

1334
03:20:26,848 --> 03:20:29,474
RIGHT NOW HE'S IN TROUBLE.

1335
03:20:31,144 --> 03:20:34,521
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST TELL ME YOU'VE
BEEN LIVING WITH HIM ALL THESE YEARS...

1336
03:20:34,689 --> 03:20:36,648
...AND THAT YOU'RE HIS LOVER?

1337
03:20:45,491 --> 03:20:48,493
AGE CAN WITHER ME, NOODLES.

1338
03:20:52,206 --> 03:20:54,833
WE'RE BOTH GETTING OLD.

1339
03:21:00,173 --> 03:21:03,467
ALL THAT WE HAVE LEFT NOW
ARE OUR MEMORIES.

1340
03:21:06,387 --> 03:21:12,350
IF YOU GO TO THAT PARTY ON SATURDAY
NIGHT, YOU WON'T HAVE THOSE ANYMORE.

1341
03:21:13,644 --> 03:21:16,188
TEAR UP THAT INVITATION.

1342
03:21:18,483 --> 03:21:21,193
THERE'S AN EXIT BACK THIS WAY.

1343
03:21:22,111 --> 03:21:25,030
NOODLES, GO THROUGH IT.

1344
03:21:27,700 --> 03:21:29,576
KEEP WALKING.

1345
03:21:29,786 --> 03:21:32,037
DON'T TURN AROUND.

1346
03:21:33,164 --> 03:21:35,415
PLEASE, NOODLES.

1347
03:21:35,583 --> 03:21:38,710
I'M BEGGING YOU. PLEASE.

1348
03:21:45,176 --> 03:21:48,720
ARE YOU AFRAID THAT I'LL TURN
INTO A PILLAR OF SALT?

1349
03:21:52,183 --> 03:21:55,977
IF YOU GO OUT THAT DOOR, YES.

1350
03:22:54,203 --> 03:22:57,164
THIS IS SECRETARY BAILEY'S SON.

1351
03:22:57,373 --> 03:23:00,876
HIS NAME'S DAVID, JUST LIKE YOURS.

1352
03:25:52,423 --> 03:25:54,257
PLEASE GO IN.

1353
03:26:08,647 --> 03:26:10,815
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

1354
03:26:14,653 --> 03:26:17,113
I DON'T UNDERSTAND, MR. BAILEY.

1355
03:26:43,808 --> 03:26:45,892
SIT DOWN, NOODLES.

1356
03:26:50,147 --> 03:26:51,940
MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE.

1357
03:27:10,334 --> 03:27:13,044
I'M GLAD YOU ACCEPTED MY INVITATION.

1358
03:27:13,212 --> 03:27:15,213
WELL, I WAS CURIOUS.

1359
03:27:18,175 --> 03:27:21,302
SO MANY IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN ONE PLACE.

1360
03:27:21,512 --> 03:27:25,390
YES. WELL, THE RATS USUALLY
DESERT A SINKING SHIP.

1361
03:27:25,850 --> 03:27:29,769
BUT IN MY CASE, THEY APPEAR TO BE
FLOCKING ONBOARD.

1362
03:27:41,407 --> 03:27:45,243
YEAH, WELL, I READ ABOUT
YOUR TROUBLES IN THE NEWSPAPERS.

1363
03:27:46,620 --> 03:27:51,291
BUT A MAN IN YOUR POSITION, WITH ALL
YOUR POWER AND ALL YOUR PRIVILEGES...

1364
03:27:51,500 --> 03:27:55,753
...HAS TO ASSUME A CERTAIN AMOUNT
OF RESPONSIBILITY...

1365
03:27:56,422 --> 03:27:58,882
...A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF RISK.

1366
03:28:06,348 --> 03:28:09,100
WHY'D YOU ASK ME
TO COME HERE, MR. BAILEY?

1367
03:28:12,438 --> 03:28:16,941
THAT INVITATION DOESN'T MEAN
A GODDAMN THING, AND YOU KNOW IT.

1368
03:28:17,318 --> 03:28:20,862
ALL THAT COUNTS IS WHAT
WAS IN THAT SUITCASE.

1369
03:28:22,531 --> 03:28:25,241
THE MONEY AND THE CONTRACT.

1370
03:28:28,078 --> 03:28:31,289
IT DIDN'T SAY WHO THE CONTRACT
WAS ON, THOUGH.

1371
03:28:32,625 --> 03:28:35,043
HAVEN'T YOU FIGURED THAT OUT YET?

1372
03:28:36,754 --> 03:28:38,296
YOU, MR. BAILEY?

1373
03:28:52,102 --> 03:28:55,813
I HAVEN'T HAD A GUN IN MY HAND
FOR MANY, MANY YEARS.

1374
03:28:57,441 --> 03:29:02,987
MY EYES AREN'T TOO GOOD,
EVEN WITH MY GLASSES. MY HANDS SHAKE.

1375
03:29:05,866 --> 03:29:09,869
-AND I WOULDN'T WANNA MISS, MR. BAILEY.
-CUT THE BULLSHIT, NOODLES.

1376
03:29:11,413 --> 03:29:14,165
I'M ALREADY A DEAD MAN.

1377
03:29:15,084 --> 03:29:19,504
AT LEAST GIVE ME THE CHANCE
TO SETTLE THE DEBT THAT I OWE TO YOU.

1378
03:29:20,172 --> 03:29:23,675
I'LL NEVER MAKE IT BEFORE
THE INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE.

1379
03:29:23,842 --> 03:29:27,804
THEY'RE SCARED TO DEATH
I'LL IMPLICATE THE WHOLE BUNCH OF THEM.

1380
03:29:28,180 --> 03:29:30,390
THEY GOTTA GET RID OF ME.

1381
03:29:33,060 --> 03:29:36,020
TODAY IS AS GOOD A DAY AS ANY.

1382
03:29:38,190 --> 03:29:40,567
YOU DO IT, NOODLES.

1383
03:29:41,527 --> 03:29:44,904
YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON
I CAN ACCEPT IT FROM.

1384
03:29:51,787 --> 03:29:54,372
YOU SEE, I FOUND OUT WHERE YOU WERE.

1385
03:29:54,540 --> 03:29:57,625
I BROUGHT YOU BACK HERE FOR THIS.

1386
03:29:58,961 --> 03:30:02,171
TO EVEN THE SCORE BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

1387
03:30:04,550 --> 03:30:07,010
YOU CAN GET OUT THROUGH THERE.

1388
03:30:14,268 --> 03:30:18,813
IT LEADS RIGHT DOWN TO THE STREET.
NOBODY WILL SEE YOU.

1389
03:30:25,571 --> 03:30:29,949
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT,
MR. BAILEY. YOU DON'T OWE ME A THING.

1390
03:30:37,916 --> 03:30:44,047
YOUR EYES WERE TOO FULL OF TEARS TO SEE
IT WASN'T ME BURNED UP ON THAT STREET.

1391
03:30:44,882 --> 03:30:46,758
IT WAS SOMEBODY ELSE.

1392
03:30:48,344 --> 03:30:53,264
YOU WERE TOO SHOCKED TO REALIZE
THAT THE COPS WERE IN ON IT TOO.

1393
03:30:53,891 --> 03:30:57,101
THAT WAS A SYNDICATE
OPERATION, NOODLES.

1394
03:31:07,404 --> 03:31:09,405
YOU'RE CRAZY.

1395
03:31:11,867 --> 03:31:16,120
YOU SAID THAT TO ME ONCE BEFORE,
A LONG TIME AGO.

1396
03:31:16,413 --> 03:31:19,874
BUT MY MIND WAS NEVER AS CLEAR
AS IT WAS AT THAT MOMENT.

1397
03:31:20,626 --> 03:31:24,128
I TOOK AWAY YOUR WHOLE LIFE FROM YOU.

1398
03:31:24,338 --> 03:31:27,173
I'VE BEEN LIVING IN YOUR PLACE.

1399
03:31:28,384 --> 03:31:31,010
I TOOK EVERYTHING.

1400
03:31:32,429 --> 03:31:34,597
I TOOK YOUR MONEY.

1401
03:31:35,224 --> 03:31:37,433
I TOOK YOUR GIRL.

1402
03:31:38,143 --> 03:31:42,939
ALL I LEFT FOR YOU WAS 35 YEARS OF GRIEF
OVER HAVING KILLED ME.

1403
03:31:44,525 --> 03:31:45,566
NOW, WHY DON'T YOU SHOOT?

1404
03:33:21,205 --> 03:33:24,123
IT'S TRUE,
I HAVE KILLED PEOPLE, MR. BAILEY.

1405
03:33:24,333 --> 03:33:29,086
SOMETIMES TO DEFEND MYSELF,
SOMETIMES FOR MONEY.

1406
03:33:29,379 --> 03:33:31,923
AND MANY PEOPLE USED TO COME TO US.

1407
03:33:32,132 --> 03:33:35,051
BUSINESS PARTNERS, RIVALS...

1408
03:33:35,427 --> 03:33:37,595
...LOVERS.

1409
03:33:37,971 --> 03:33:42,099
SOME OF THE JOBS WE TOOK
AND SOME WE DIDN'T.

1410
03:33:55,489 --> 03:33:58,449
YOURS IS ONE WE WOULD NEVER TOUCH,
MR. BAILEY.

1411
03:33:59,326 --> 03:34:02,286
IS THIS YOUR WAY OF GETTING REVENGE?

1412
03:34:06,250 --> 03:34:07,834
NO.

1413
03:34:11,171 --> 03:34:14,298
IT'S JUST THE WAY I SEE THINGS.

1414
03:35:16,987 --> 03:35:19,780
IT'S 10:25...

1415
03:35:21,074 --> 03:35:24,243
...AND I'VE GOT NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE.

1416
03:35:26,371 --> 03:35:30,333
WHEN YOU'VE BEEN BETRAYED BY A FRIEND,
YOU HIT BACK.

1417
03:35:35,380 --> 03:35:37,214
DO IT.

1418
03:35:59,363 --> 03:36:01,989
YOU SEE, MR. SECRETARY...

1419
03:36:03,992 --> 03:36:06,077
...I HAVE A STORY ALSO.

1420
03:36:07,037 --> 03:36:09,580
A LITTLE SIMPLER THAN YOURS.

1421
03:36:10,707 --> 03:36:15,419
MANY YEARS AGO I HAD A FRIEND,
A DEAR FRIEND.

1422
03:36:17,047 --> 03:36:20,299
I TURNED HIM IN TO SAVE HIS LIFE...

1423
03:36:20,509 --> 03:36:22,802
...BUT HE WAS KILLED.

1424
03:36:24,096 --> 03:36:26,931
BUT HE WANTED IT THAT WAY.

1425
03:36:27,975 --> 03:36:30,184
IT WAS A GREAT FRIENDSHIP.

1426
03:36:33,271 --> 03:36:37,316
IT WENT BAD FOR HIM
AND IT WENT BAD FOR ME TOO.

1427
03:36:42,280 --> 03:36:44,448
GOOD NIGHT, MR. BAILEY.

1428
03:36:53,625 --> 03:36:57,336
I HOPE THE INVESTIGATION
TURNS OUT TO BE NOTHING.

1429
03:36:59,256 --> 03:37:03,300
IT'D BE A SHAME TO SEE
A LIFETIME OF WORK GO TO WASTE.

1430
03:40:28,882 --> 03:40:33,552
GOD BLESS AMERICA

1431
03:40:33,720 --> 03:40:37,973
LAND THAT I LOVE

1432
03:40:38,141 --> 03:40:42,811
STAND BESIDE HER
AND GUIDE HER

1433
03:40:43,104 --> 03:40:46,315
THROUGH THE NIGHT
WITH A LIGHT FROM ABOVE

1434
03:40:48,068 --> 03:40:52,821
FROM THE MOUNTAINS
TO THE PRAIRIES

1435
03:40:52,989 --> 03:40:57,368
TO THE OCEANS WHITE WITH FOAM

1436
03:40:58,411 --> 03:41:02,581
GOD BLESS AMERICA

1437
03:41:02,749 --> 03:41:06,919
MY HOME SWEET HOME

1438
03:41:08,338 --> 03:41:13,092
GOD BLESS AMERICA

1439
03:41:13,260 --> 03:41:17,304
LAND THAT I LOVE

1440
03:41:17,472 --> 03:41:22,351
STAND BESIDE HER
AND GUIDE HER
